<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A
LETTER, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>
<p>Divided as the country is in its political and religious
sentiments, there is one subject on which there is a very great
unanimity: and I may add also that this union of opinion exists
among the most moral of your countrymen; the most loyal
supporters of the throne and the constitution; the most
enlightened members of the community; and the most benevolent and
philanthropic individuals in the empire.&nbsp; I need not say
that the point on which all these persons are agreed is
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The observance of
Sabbath</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, my Lord, you have thousands or
rather millions of citizens who never trouble the realm in any
way by their vices or disorderly conduct; who are never brought
before magistrates or judges for their offences; and who require
no soldiers or police to watch over them and keep them from
disturbing the commonwealth.</p>
<p>It is a matter of surprise to all sober and reflecting minds
that you, my Lord, should wish to set yourself in an attitude of
antagonism towards all these peaceful and religious men and
women; and especially that you should do this most
<i>gratuitously</i> and in <i>defiance of your own creed</i>.</p>
<p>In proposing to have the Pleasure Grounds of the new Crystal
Palace thrown open during one half of the Lord&rsquo;s-day, you
involved yourself in a responsibility which no one called upon
you to incur, except a small body of railway speculators, and a
few theoretic and practical rejectors of the commandments of the
Most High.&nbsp; Your coadjutors and instigators are those who
never allow a word of Scripture to stand in the way of their
views, their pleasures, their prejudices, or their love of
gain.&nbsp; It has become popular of late years for prime
ministers &ldquo;to do evil that good may come.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Maynooth grant was asked for by few.&nbsp; The Catholics
themselves did not want it.&nbsp; There has rarely been a measure
which met with such unanimous opposition; but still it was
carried&mdash;<i>most tyrannically</i> carried&mdash;in defiance
of the voice of the nation: and, how has it worked?&nbsp; The
believers in <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Roman Catholicism knew that it was intended as a bribe,
and therefore an insult; and have resolved that they will not be
converted into spiritual chattels, or have their zeal quenched or
consciences silenced by Government pay.&nbsp; The money was taken
from our pockets to purchase state patronage for the premier and
his partisans, but the artifice has proved a perfect failure, for
the followers of <i>Pio Nono</i> have shown that they are not to
be bought.&nbsp; Your measure, my Lord, concerning the Sabbath is
as perfectly gratuitous as the Maynooth scheme.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; In wishing to grant a charter for the violation of
the Lord&rsquo;s-day, you, my Lord, tried to play the same game
as your predecessors.&nbsp; The profit of a small company of
railway kings was the chief thing sought; and to obtain their
smile, you were willing to risk the favour of the King of Kings,
to endanger the morals of the country, and consequently the
Throne, the Constitution, and the Church; and you were also
setting yourself in an attitude of defiance against the best and
most patriotic of your countrymen.&nbsp; There might, my Lord,
have been boldness in this effort of yours to undermine the
Sabbath and trample upon the consciences of the majority of the
nation, but the infatuation was equal to the courage.&nbsp; You
have long been ambitious of power.&nbsp; The deep and settled
opinion in your own mind for a long time has been, that both as a
profoundly wise and apostolically religious man, you, my Lord,
and you alone, were the <i>only</i> person in the realm qualified
to guide the affairs of this great empire.&nbsp; Your Lordship
has for some years put yourself forward as the bulwark of the
Church and of pure Christianity.&nbsp; All persons who differed
from you have been viewed as heretics and sinners exceedingly;
and you are, according to your own showing, a model saint, the
moral hero and spiritual Wellington of religion and the Bible;
and yet, after all these high pretensions, no sooner were you in
power than your first effort on behalf of Christianity was to
announce to the country that you were about to set the authority
of your royal mistress against the command of the King of Heaven;
and, in doing so, you alienated from yourself and your
administration the minds of the majority of the religious people
whom you promised to serve if you could only obtain the reins of
government.</p>
<p>By many of the most devout members of your Church, your
premiership was hailed as the advent of another Luther or
Wickliffe, and you covered all these with chagrin and shame by
your gratuitous violation of the law of the Most High.&nbsp;
There never was a specimen of greater infatuation in a statesman
who aimed at popularity and almost vaunted of preeminence in
religious zeal.&nbsp; You, my Lord, great as your power may have
been, were hardly high enough to despise the favour or
indignation of the Ruler of the Universe.&nbsp; Read history, my
Lord, and you cannot find a single Sabbath breaking nation but
has paid dearly for its ungodliness.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s-day,
scripturally observed, would have saved France from the
convulsions <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>and bloodshed which have made it a warning to the
world.&nbsp; Sabbath breaking sent the Jews to Babylon, and gave
them seventy years of captivity that &ldquo;the land might enjoy
her Sabbath,&rdquo; and that all ages might learn that the
Almighty will not have His commands set at nought with
impunity.</p>
<p>But supposing you had possessed such power that you could have
said, &ldquo;<i>I fear not God</i>,&rdquo; yet sound policy might
have suggested that it would be well to have some
&ldquo;<i>regard to man</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; You really were not
quite secure in your post as prime minister.&nbsp; A few votes of
the senate deprived you in an instant of all your authority; and
you fell because you rendered yourself unpopular in the
estimation of the nation.&nbsp; You ought also to know that
religion is a sacred thing in the eyes of all, whether Pagans,
Jews, Mahommedans, or Christians.&nbsp; To touch the ark has
brought destruction upon many an &ldquo;Uzzah&rdquo; without any
special intervention of heaven; and you, my Lord, are not too
high for their doom.&nbsp; The majority which sustained you in
office was very small and doubtful; and nothing sunk you so low
in the estimation of thousands as this Sabbath desecration, which
you proposed to establish by a royal charter!!&nbsp; By many you
were looked upon as the bulwark of the Church and religion; and
by your own speeches you wished to make the country believe that
you were a very godly man; and yet without the least substantial
reason you blasted all their hopes, and, in their estimation, you
have denied the faith, and become worse than an
infidel&mdash;because an <i>unbeliever</i> has no reverence, and
can have no reverence for the Word of God; but you profess to
<i>believe</i> in its divine origin, and to be guided by its
sacred injunctions, and thus sinned with your eyes open: you have
therefore foolishly, most gratuitously, alienated your friends,
and hastened your own downfal, and all to please the avarice and
fill the coffers of a small clique of gentlemen who prefer
&ldquo;gain to godliness.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; You have not only been guilty of the most gratuitous
presumption and rashness, but you have also acted in defiance of
your own creed.&nbsp; You, my Lord, according to your own
showing, are a very religious, indeed, an apostolically
religious, man&mdash;a believer in the Church Catechism, and in
the doctrine of confirmation.&nbsp; Doubtless your Lordship has
been confirmed; and I may presume that you go to church as often
as the majority of your order; and, when there, you listen very
attentively to the reading of the decalogue, and after each
precept you most devoutly and sincerely repeat the prayer,
&ldquo;<i>Lord have mercy upon us</i>, <i>and incline our hearts
to keep this law</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; At the end of the tenth
command you vary the words, and say, &ldquo;<i>Lord have mercy
upon us</i>, <span class="GutSmall">AND WRITE</span> ALL <span
class="GutSmall">THESE THY LAWS IN OUR HEARTS</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">WE BESEECH THEE</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Communion Service of the Prayer Book, I read the
following words:&mdash;&ldquo;Then shall the priest, turning to
the people, rehearse distinctly <span class="GutSmall">ALL THE
TEN</span> commandments; and the <i>people</i>, <i>still
kneeling</i>, shall after <i>every</i> commandment <i>ask mercy
for their transgression</i> thereof, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and grace to <i>keep</i> the same for
time to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; In accordance with this direction the
clergyman in a solemn voice commences with Exodus xx. 1:
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God spake these words and
said</span>;&rdquo; and thus wishes to impress upon the devout
and kneeling audience before him, that the laws which he is about
to rehearse are the identical laws which were once proclaimed by
Jehovah himself, and that they have now all the majesty and
authority of the Divine Legislator which they have ever
had.&nbsp; When he comes to the <i>fourth</i>, he reads,
&ldquo;Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day.&nbsp; Six
days shalt thou labour, and do <i>all</i> that thou hast to do;
but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.&nbsp; In
it thou shalt do no manner of work, <i>thou</i>, and thy son, and
thy daughter, thy man servant, and thy maid servant, thy cattle,
and the stranger that is within thy gates.&nbsp; For in six days
the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,
and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the
seventh day, and hallowed it.&rdquo;&nbsp; No sooner are these
words ended, than you, my Lord, and all true Churchmen, all
newspaper editors and railway directors, who go to church on
Sunday mornings, repeat the solemn prayer given above.&nbsp; In
the sentence, &ldquo;<i>Lord have mercy upon us</i>,&rdquo; you
confess that you have broken the commandment, and pray the God of
Heaven to grant you &ldquo;<i>mercy</i>&rdquo; for the past; and
in the following words, &ldquo;<i>Incline our hearts to keep this
law</i>,&rdquo; you entreat Jehovah to renew your hearts, and
give you an inclination to obey the &ldquo;<i>Fourth
Commandment</i>&rdquo; in future.&nbsp; Are you, my Lord, sincere
in this prayer and supplication?&nbsp; Are your Church friends
among the nobility, railway companies, and newspaper editors, who
use this form of devotion, sincere?&nbsp; The Son of God tests
our love by our obedience.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye love me, keep my
commandments,&rdquo; are his sacred injunctions, plainly teaching
us that if we violate his commands we give a public demonstration
that we do not love him.&nbsp; Now, to keep the Sabbath <i>one
half</i> of the day and violate it the other, is to furnish but a
very poor proof that we feel any deference for the Fourth
Commandment.</p>
<p>My Lord, would you be satisfied that your commands to your
servants should be <i>half</i> broken and <i>half</i> kept?&nbsp;
Are you pleased with your coachman if he drives you <i>half</i>
way to church on the Sabbath when your command is to be driven
<i>all</i> the way?&nbsp; Do you like to have your will in any
other particular but <i>half</i> done?&nbsp; Would you be pleased
to have your hunters and racehorses but <i>half</i> fed and
<i>half</i> groomed, or your food but <i>half</i> cooked?&nbsp;
Yet we may ask, Who is the Earl of Derby, that his commands
should be <i>perfectly</i> obeyed to the very letter, while the
God of Heaven, at the instance of this same Earl of Derby, is to
be satisfied with only a moiety of that obedience which he has
enjoined in the Scripture?</p>
<p>What, my Lord, if you comprehended all your own wishes in
&ldquo;<i>Ten Commands</i>,&rdquo; and summoned all your servants
into your presence once a week and directed your chief steward to
read in their ears your injunctions, commencing with the
sentence, &ldquo;The Earl of Derby spake these words and
said&rdquo;; and what if all your attendants <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>fell on their
knees before you, and, in the most pitiful language, confessed
that they had rebelled against your precepts; implored mercy for
their transgressions; earnestly entreated you to assist them in
their future efforts to do your pleasure; and, having satisfied
themselves that you had pardoned them, immediately rose from the
ground and resolved in future to be more guilty than ever by
neglecting your commands altogether, or by only attending to
<i>half</i> their import!&nbsp; Could you put up, my Lord, with
this farce week after week and year after year?&nbsp; Would it
require fifty-two repetitions of such insolence to exhaust your
patience?&nbsp; Would the Earl of Derby allow himself to be thus
insulted even a second time?&nbsp; Would you not denounce these
impudent menials as a set of mocking hypocrites?&nbsp; But is it
a matter of more importance that the Earl of Derby should not be
mocked than that the God of Heaven should be worshipped in
sincerity and in truth?&nbsp; Let me then entreat your Lordship,
as you value your present consistency and future happiness,
either to reverence the Fourth Commandment, or else cease to use
the prayer attached to it in the Liturgy.</p>
<p>But perhaps you may say, &ldquo;that you neither disobey it,
nor teach others to do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; I need not tell your
Lordship, as a learned man, and the Chancellor of one of the
great seats of learning, that the day mentioned by Moses, and
which you pray the Almighty to give you grace to observe, is
<span class="GutSmall">TWENTY-FOUR HOURS LONG</span>; that during
these twenty-four hours we are commanded to abstain from all
manner of work; that we are &ldquo;to keep the day holy to
Jehovah,&rdquo; and consequently to observe it religiously by not
&ldquo;doing our own ways, finding our own pleasure, or speaking
our own words.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the command of the King of
Kings.&nbsp; How then can the <i>half</i> observance of the
Lord&rsquo;s-day be reconciled with the divine command to keep
the <i>whole</i>?&nbsp; If the railway to Sydenham is to be
worked on the Sabbath, and the pleasure grounds thrown open, you
will of necessity doom a large number of clerks, stokers,
drivers, porters, waiters and others to labour on that day on
which Jehovah has commanded that no work shall be done.&nbsp; The
God of Heaven says, &ldquo;Thou shalt do no manner of
work&rdquo;; but the Earl of Derby tells the people that they
<i>may</i> work on the Sabbath!&nbsp; You thus set yourself in a
position of antagonism against the Creator of the Universe.&nbsp;
The Scriptures assert that &ldquo;The Son of Man is the Lord of
the Sabbath&rdquo;; but you, my Lord, intimate that the Earl of
Derby is the Lord of the Sabbath!!&nbsp; When &ldquo;God
spake,&rdquo; he solemnly commanded that the <i>whole</i> day
should be observed; but when the Earl of Derby spoke, he said
&ldquo;<i>Let half the day be kept</i>,&rdquo; thus making
himself not only equal but superior to the Almighty!</p>
<p>It is no use, my Lord, to plead that only a few hands
comparatively will be employed, because you have no right to doom
even <i>one</i> man to lose his day of rest and sin against God,
for the gain and gratification of others.&nbsp; One soul is of
more value than the whole world; and I query whether your
Lordship will be willing to stand at the bar <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of the Eternal
in the stead of the poor labourers whom you condemned to toil on
the seventh day, and thus converted into Sabbath breakers.&nbsp;
And it would not be one, two, or ten, who would be robbed of the
rest of the Sabbath, but the opening the grounds at Sydenham on
Sunday would be the condemnation of hundreds of our countrymen to
this seventh-day slavery.&nbsp; Why should railway companies be
permitted to exact Sunday labour from their servants, and yet
grocers, drapers, tradesmen, and manufacturers be prohibited from
similar gains?&nbsp; The age is passing away for legislative
favouritism; and if one company may have royal authority to work,
oppress and destroy their vassals, why should not all the shops
be thrown open: why should not the anvil, the saw and the spade
be used, and all apprentices and labourers be called upon to be
Sunday slaves?&nbsp; Such labour will minister to the pleasure
and profit of many.&nbsp; It is rather remarkable, that almost
the same day in which your good lady was announced, in connection
with the Duchess of Sutherland and others, as an opponent to
American slavery, you, my Lord, proclaimed yourself as the patron
of English slavery! and might have founded your arguments on the
same principles as the Transatlantic planters.&nbsp; Uncle Tom
was enslaved for the profit and pleasure of his masters; and
clerks, drivers, stokers, &amp;c., &amp;c., are to be enslaved on
the Sabbath to enrich their employers, and to minister to the
gratification of the irreligious portion of the community who
&ldquo;are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, the American slave in many instances is
allowed his full day of rest on the Sabbath; but the white slave
of the railway and of Sydenham is to know nothing of the repose
of that day which Jehovah has set apart for the benefit not only
of the sons and daughters of toil, but also of animals, for it
was one of God&rsquo;s commands to the Jews that &ldquo;the ox
and the ass should rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, my Lord, if you persevere now you are out of
office, in this wish to have the Sabbath desecrated, you will
also, in accordance with your public <span
class="GutSmall">DISSENT</span> from the Church of England,
demand that the Prayer Book shall be altered.&nbsp; You will for
consistency sake request the Convocation, to which you are said
to be very favourable, to immediately set about the re-formation
of the Liturgy as their very first work.&nbsp; By all means let
the Fourth Commandment be omitted from the Catechism; let all
reference to it be erased from the Baptismal Service; let
sponsors no longer be called upon &ldquo;to promise and
vow&rdquo; that their godchildren shall &ldquo;keep God&rsquo;s
holy will and commandments and walk in the same all the days of
their life&rdquo;; and, in the service of Confirmation, let the
candidates be duly taught that in taking their vows upon them,
they are, on the authority of the Earl of Derby, freed from the
observance of the Sabbath; let the priests of the Church also be
informed that to read the Fourth Commandment is an absurdity now
it is abolished; and above all, never again let heaven be mocked,
piety outraged, and common sense insulted by the repetition of
the prayer, &ldquo;Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our
hearts to keep this law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why should not a second <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>book of sports
be read from the pulpits of the Establishment, and the people be
duly apprised that the words of the Eternal respecting the
seventh day, &ldquo;In it thou shalt do no manner of work,
<i>thou</i>, nor <i>thy son</i>, nor <i>thy daughter</i>, <i>thy
man servant</i>, <i>thy maid servant</i>, <i>thy cattle</i>, and
<i>the stranger</i> within thy gates,&rdquo; are now of no force,
for the Earl of Derby has proclaimed that railway speculators may
compel their servants to work on the seventh day, and as a
consequence that all other persons may &ldquo;go and do
likewise&rdquo;?</p>
<p>You have, my Lord, by your changing, often surprised your
countrymen; but this wish to trample the Prayer Book in the dust,
to set Baptism, Catechism, Confirmation, the Communion Service,
and the Word of God at defiance, is a revolution which none of
your friends or foes were prepared to expect, and should you
succeed will be attended with greater evils to the masses and
greater calamities to the nation than have ever yet
occurred.&nbsp; England owes all to her Bible and her Sabbaths;
and I may add, that the Scriptures would have been of little good
without her <i>Sabbaths</i>.&nbsp; Abolish, my Lord, the rest of
the seventh day, and you may write &ldquo;Ichabod&rdquo; on our
walls.&nbsp; The Bible has been but partially studied by those
nations who reject the Lord&rsquo;s-day, and their history and
present condition show that they have paid very dearly for this
neglect.</p>
<p>But, my Lord, if you have power, supposing you were prime
minister, to annul the Fourth Commandment, then you have power to
abolish all the rest.&nbsp; If you can command that the Sabbath
shall be <i>half</i> kept and can give men a charter to break the
other <i>half</i>, you certainly have power to allow them to
break it altogether; and if you can grant a royal commission to
violate <i>one</i> precept of the decalogue, you can license the
people to break the whole.&nbsp; And, my Lord, you must not stop,
for there are persons to whom the <i>Sixth</i>, the
<i>Seventh</i> and <i>Eighth</i> Commandments are as great an
obstruction to their profit or pleasure as the Fourth Command is
to the Sydenham gentlemen.&nbsp; How many thieves could enrich
themselves but for the Eighth Command; and how many might relieve
themselves of the burden of dependents or jump into rich
inheritances, by trampling the Sixth in the dust!&nbsp; Yea, my
Lord, were they only allowed by a royal charter to violate one
<i>half</i> of these commandments, by half starving, half killing
and half robbing their fellow creatures, no one can tell the
property that might be saved or gained.&nbsp; Here would be a
&ldquo;MAGNA CHARTA&rdquo; with a vengeance, and one, my Lord,
which would immortalize your name to all eternity.&nbsp; The
dead, by the million, would proclaim your fame or your
infamy.&nbsp; And there can be no just reason given why, if you
granted a charter to railway speculators to enable them to rob
their servants of the Sabbath, you should not give other
worshippers of Mammon equal power to plunder and oppress; for I
shall presently have to show that to deprive the physical frame
of rest once in seven days is both robbery and murder, and
therefore if you begin to charter these outrages, you will find
it difficult to stop.&nbsp; It will be only for any company to
make out a case and prove that <i>pleasure</i> and <i>profit</i>
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>will be
the result of oppression, robbery and death, and you, to be
consistent, must advocate their cause.</p>
<p>The change in The Prayer Book too must be greater than at
first was contemplated.&nbsp; Instead of praying &ldquo;Lord have
mercy upon us, and write ALL these THY commandments in our
hearts, we beseech thee&rdquo;; or, when the fourth is abolished,
&ldquo;Lord have mercy upon us, and write NINE of these THY
commandments in our hearts, we beseech thee,&rdquo; you will have
to obliterate them from the Liturgy altogether.&nbsp; And indeed
wherever in the prayers, thanksgivings, or collects there is any
reference to the commandments of Jehovah, the words must be
omitted in the re-formed Prayer Book.&nbsp; Of course, my Lord,
after this great and stupendous change, we shall hear no more of
the heresy of Nonconformists, and the wonder of modern times will
be, not, &ldquo;Is Saul among the prophets?&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Is
the Earl of Derby among dissenters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other Prayer Book reforms, my Lord, will have to follow.&nbsp;
To preserve your consistency it will be needful to omit the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&nbsp; Five times in the full morning service
of your Church the petition is offered, &ldquo;Lead us not into
temptation,&rdquo; and yet when your devotions are ended you wish
to proclaim by royal charter that the people shall be
<i>tempted</i> to break the Sabbath.&nbsp; I need not tell your
Lordship as a learned divine, that &ldquo;temptation,&rdquo; in
the prayer alluded to, means, temptation &ldquo;<i>to
sin</i>,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;<i>to sin</i>&rdquo; is to
violate the commandments of Jehovah.&nbsp; When therefore you
pray not to be led &ldquo;into temptation,&rdquo; you intimate
that your nature is weak, and entreat our heavenly Father to
prevent your being placed in any position in which your pious
principles would be likely to give way.&nbsp; How strange then
that you, who are so sensitive of your own frailty,
notwithstanding the robustness of your piety, should propose to
have the young, the morally feeble and undecided, tempted every
seventh day to trample the commandment of heaven in the
dust!&nbsp; Surely, my Lord, if it is of so much importance that
yourself and all the railway directors and pious newspaper
editors who go to church, should be kept from temptation, that
you pray <i>five times</i> in the morning service for divine
protection, then it is also necessary that the poor vulgar herd
of sinners, who have so little of your apostolical godliness,
should also be preserved from temptation.&nbsp; It seems
inexplicably marvellous that you should exhibit so much care of
your own piety and morality, and yet be so reckless about the
virtue of your poorer neighbours as actually to propose that
other persons, by royal charter, should be led into that very
temptation to sin from which you <i>five times</i> on the Sabbath
morning entreat the Almighty to enable you to escape.&nbsp;
Either, my Lord, invite the Convocation to obliterate the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer as well as the ten commandments from the
Liturgy, or else cease to instigate the nation to rebel against
the Word of God.&nbsp; In fact, if you continue to advocate
Sabbath breaking, you ought to leave the Church and reject the
Liturgy, or to have the words &ldquo;<i>command</i>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>commandments</i>&rdquo; expunged from every prayer and
collect in the Prayer Book.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Need I
remind your Lordship, that the words &ldquo;Thy kingdom come, thy
will be done in earth as it is in heaven,&rdquo; refer to the ten
commandments?&nbsp; The kingdom of God will come when his
commands are obeyed, just as the kingdom of our Queen extends
wherever her laws are observed.&nbsp; Where the laws of England
are trampled in the dust, there the sceptre of Victoria is set at
nought; and just in the same manner, so long as the laws of the
decalogue are disregarded, the kingdom of God cannot come.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The will of God&rdquo; will &ldquo;be done in earth as it
is in heaven,&rdquo; when his laws are obeyed, because his will
is embodied in his commandments.&nbsp; But if you propose to
grant the nation or a few of your favourites a royal charter to
break the divine commands, doubtless you will also have the
petitions &ldquo;Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as
it is in heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;deliver us from evil,&rdquo;
&amp;c., &amp;c., erased from the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and from
the Prayer Book.&nbsp; Indeed so few of the words of the Saviour
will remain, when all reference to obedience to the laws of God
is obliterated, that for very shame the mutilated part must be
abandoned.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine that after proposing this charter for Sabbath
breaking, you will ever repeat the words, &ldquo;God be merciful
unto us and bless us, and show us the light of his countenance
and be merciful unto us.&nbsp; <i>That thy way may be known upon
earth</i>, <i>thy saving health among all
nations</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s &ldquo;way&rdquo; is his
commandments, and there is no &ldquo;<i>saving health</i>&rdquo;
except in obeying them.&nbsp; But to give a royal charter to set
at nought the Fourth or any other Command, is to do what you can
to prevent God&rsquo;s &ldquo;way&rdquo; from being &ldquo;known
upon the earth,&rdquo; and therefore of course you will have this
Psalm expunged from evening service, or else never unite in
repeating or chanting it.&nbsp; Your conduct, my Lord, for the
sake of consistency, must demand the most sweeping alterations in
the Prayer Book.</p>
<p>I have thus shown, my Lord, that you cannot be a true
Churchman, nor a devout worshipper according to the forms of the
Liturgy, if you advocate Sabbath desecration; and hence your
desire to make such an irreligious use of your power has not only
been gratuitous, unwise, and impolitic, but also a most glaring
contradiction of your own professed principles.&nbsp; James
speaks of &ldquo;the <i>superfluity</i> of naughtiness,&rdquo;
and you, my Lord, have given to the nation a public commentary on
the words, and to do so have deeply reflected on your own
consistency.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Truth and humanity tell us, my Lord, that your
proposition is not only inconsistent with your creed, but also
that it is very <span class="GutSmall">CRUEL</span> to a large
number of your fellow citizens.&nbsp; The Redeemer has said that
&ldquo;<i>The Sabbath was made for man</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now man
is a compound being, consisting of a frail body and an immortal
soul.&nbsp; His body requires periodical rest; his soul stands in
need of religious instruction; and the Fourth Command contains
<i>two</i> parts exactly corresponding with these <i>two</i>
exigencies of our race.&nbsp; It demands
&ldquo;<i>rest</i>&rdquo; from labour for the body; it enjoins
&ldquo;<i>holiness to the Lord</i>&rdquo; for the soul.&nbsp; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy: six
days shalt thou labour and do all that thou hast to do,&rdquo;
&amp;c., &amp;c., are words which embrace these two
principles.&nbsp; Holiness is the work of the soul.&nbsp; You
cannot make a body holy; because holiness, or religion, is an
intellectual and spiritual business.&nbsp; It is true you may
employ the body in a holy or unholy manner, but then the moral
principle, which sins or obeys, is in the soul, and the bodily
members are only the instruments with which the heart
accomplishes its good or wicked desires.&nbsp; When therefore the
Scriptures command us to hallow or consecrate one day in seven,
they enjoin a duty which can only be performed by an intelligent
and voluntary being; and consequently one with which human
legislation has nothing to do, except to see that no one shall be
robbed of the liberty or power of attending to it.&nbsp; There is
no government, prince, monarch, or emperor in the world that has
a right to dictate to mankind respecting the <i>religious</i>
observance of the Lord&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; Here men must be left
to persuasion, exhortation, and the power of conscience.&nbsp;
And therefore, my Lord, you are not called upon to legislate on
the worship of the Sabbath.&nbsp; You must leave to others the
same right which you claim for yourself.&nbsp; Doubtless you, my
Lord, go to church, or not, according to your inclination; the
rest of the nobility act in like manner; some of them are said to
be Hom&oelig;opaths in Sabbath worship; and you really must
permit your countrymen and countrywomen to enjoy the same
freedom.&nbsp; The business of legislation is with man&rsquo;s
mortal and corporeal nature, with his property and
liberties.&nbsp; You have to guard that he be robbed of no right,
that he receive no personal injury, that his life be safe, and
his property secure; and it is on these principles of physical,
civil, and social legislation that we demand that <i>one</i> day
in seven shall be the possession of every British subject.</p>
<p>The Fourth Commandment enjoins a day of <i>rest</i> for
man&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Jehovah, who &ldquo;knoweth our
frame,&rdquo; who made us, and fully understands the capabilities
of our brain, nerves and muscles, and who may with the
profoundest reverence be termed, <i>The Great Physiologist</i>,
has set apart one day in seven for bodily rest from labour.&nbsp;
The body of Adam was stronger than ours.&nbsp; It knew no
infirmity, was enfeebled by no disease; the labour of Paradise
was comparatively light; and yet to Adam was given the rest of
the seventh day.&nbsp; And to enforce this duty on our first
parents, our merciful Creator not only sanctified the day, or
made it a <i>holy</i> and <i>sanctifying day</i> for them, but
rested himself as our example.&nbsp; There is no doubt that
antediluvian believers kept the Sabbath, and they were as strong
as we.&nbsp; We read of the observance of the Sabbath in the
wilderness <i>before</i> the law was given on Sinai, and Jehovah
worked especial miracles on the manna to enable the children of
Israel to rest on this holy day; for on the sixth he rained twice
as much food from heaven as on any other morning, and on the
seventh he preserved it from putrefaction, which always occurred
on any other day, except the Sabbath, if the manna was kept until
the morrow.&nbsp; God also said to these Israelites in the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>wilderness,
before the law was given on Sinai, that the law of the Sabbath
was to be observed &ldquo;as a <span class="GutSmall">SIGN</span>
between himself&rdquo; and his worshippers.&nbsp; We have reason
to believe that these children of Abraham were quite as strong in
nerve and muscle as we are, and we know that their labour was not
very hard, for they had during their wanderings in the wilderness
but few occupations, and yet they were commanded to rest on the
seventh day.</p>
<p>Some persons ask, Why did they rest on the <i>seventh</i> day,
and not on the <i>sixth</i>, the <i>eighth</i>, or the
<i>tenth</i>?&nbsp; Our only answer to this question is, that
God, &ldquo;who knoweth our frame,&rdquo; judged it to be best
and ordained that it should be so.&nbsp; A man may ask me why the
earth moves on her axis from the west to the east, and I confess
that I cannot give any better answer than that it is the will of
the all-wise Creator.&nbsp; I cannot give a reason why the
centipede has so many feet.&nbsp; If any person asked whether
eighty, or one hundred and one would not have been as well, I
must leave the matter in the hands of God.&nbsp; I say, &ldquo;it
is the will of God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;God is
merciful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ten thousand questions in physics might be
put to me which I could only answer by saying, &ldquo;God is
wise,&rdquo; &ldquo;God is powerful,&rdquo; &ldquo;God is
love,&rdquo; &ldquo;God is merciful, and has made the world and
our corporeal frame what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I may add one word respecting the rest of the seventh
day.&nbsp; The most distinguished physiologists assure us that
both men and cattle require to be relieved from toil at the end
of every six days.&nbsp; Gentlemen who have had much to do with
horses have assured me that it was always a dead loss to rob
those animals of the physical rest of the Sabbath, and that
horses which are so worked invariably become diseased and die
before their time.&nbsp; Before observation and physiology
brought out these facts, the great and merciful Creator gave the
command to Moses that &ldquo;<i>the ox and the ass should
rest</i>&rdquo; <i>on the seventh day</i>.&nbsp; In the evidence
on &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sabbath Observance</span>&rdquo;
which was given before the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Parliamentary Committee</span>,&rdquo; and which,
as a Government document, your Lordship has doubtless read, it is
stated by several eminent physiologists, that man&rsquo;s
<i>corporeal</i> frame requires the rest of the Sabbath, and that
to rob him of this is to injure his health and shorten his
days.&nbsp; Yea, they show that tea gardens and other places of
excitement produce baneful effects upon the brain and nerves, and
eventually lead to premature decay and dissolution.&nbsp; Hence,
my Lord, <i>physiology</i> teaches that our merciful Father, the
maker of our frame, was right and kind and compassionate in
ordaining <i>one</i> day in <i>seven</i> as a rest from
toil.&nbsp; The refreshment of sleep teaches us that the body
needs repose from continuous labour, and the Sabbath was intended
to be still more invigorating.</p>
<p>I must here remind your Lordship that <i>rest</i> is the
meaning of the word <i>Sabbath</i>.&nbsp; A sage reviewer in one
of our &ldquo;Quarterlies,&rdquo; who has been pompously quoted
by a literary brother of the &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">DAILY</span>&rdquo; press, has told us with much
learned <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, that the word
&ldquo;<i>Sabbath</i>&rdquo; means
&ldquo;<i>seven</i>&rdquo;!!&nbsp; Doubtless we shall soon hear
from the same philosophical <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>philologer that the moon is made out
of gossamer.&nbsp; The one will be as true and as scientific as
the other.&nbsp; But we may leave these critics to the
lexicons.&nbsp; You, my Lord, are distinguished as a scholar, and
therefore know full well that our term
&ldquo;<i>Sabbath</i>&rdquo; is the very identical Hebrew word
for &ldquo;<i>Rest</i>,&rdquo; and that a literal translation of
the first words of the Fourth Commandment would be,
&ldquo;Remember the <i>Day of Rest</i> to keep it
holy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Rest</i>&rdquo; from labour, then,
is the exact meaning of the word
&ldquo;<i>Sabbath</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; History and physiology show
that man&rsquo;s corporeal frame requires rest from toil every
seventh day; and the Bible teaches that our heavenly Father, who
made us thus frail, has, in pure love and mercy, commanded that
one day in seven for the repose and consequent reinvigoration of
the body shall be reserved from worldly occupations.&nbsp;
Physical laws, as well as revealed laws, are the laws of God; and
in the law of the Sabbath we have both combined to preserve the
health and life of man.&nbsp; We have here a sacred bulwark of
philanthropy, proving that the Sabbath, or <i>Rest-day</i>, was
made for man.&nbsp; The labourer, therefore, has a <i>Divine
right</i> to one day in seven as his own property.&nbsp; The
charter or title deeds which give him a claim to the full
enjoyment of the Sabbath for twenty-four hours, were signed by
the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.&nbsp; The great seal of
heaven is upon them.&nbsp; They are inscribed on the bones,
muscles, nerves, brain, heart, lungs, and digestive organs of the
human constitution, and were solemnly proclaimed by Jehovah
himself amidst the thunders of Sinai.&nbsp; No work, except what
can be shown to be absolutely necessary, must be done on the
seventh day: and he who deprives the servant, operative, or
labourer of this sacred claim to rest from toil, is both a robber
and murderer, and will be treated as such at the great day.</p>
<p>You, my Lord, must enter eternity as a child of Adam, and not
as a nobleman; and you will be acquitted or condemned accordingly
as you observed or violated the ten commandments.&nbsp; As a
sinner you may trust in the merits of Christ, but at the bar of
God your faith will be tested by your observance of the
decalogue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Faith without works is dead,&rdquo; and
cannot justify the soul.&nbsp; You will there have no ancestry to
plead, no titles to wear, and no wealth or influence to
bribe.&nbsp; Death, as to all these advantages or disadvantages
of your earthly existence, will leave you as bare and naked as
Lazarus.&nbsp; Nor will forms and ceremonies be admitted as a
substitute for the &ldquo;weightier matters of the
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Baptismal regeneration, sacramental grace, the
repetition of forms of prayer, going to church once a day, the
<i>half</i> observance of the Sabbath, and zeal for tithes and
offerings, will not stand in the place of obedience to the law
uttered on Mount Sinai.&nbsp; You must obey, or be excluded from
Paradise.&nbsp; Your obedience also must proceed from faith and
love; not a deed must be done to merit the kingdom of heaven, but
every act of piety and devotion must proceed from pure gratitude
to <span class="smcap">Him</span> who died to procure eternal
life for all who believe with a practical faith.</p>
<p>You know, my Lord, who has said, &ldquo;Whosoever therefore
shall <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>break one of these <i>least</i> commandments, and shall
teach men so, the same shall be called <i>least</i> in the
kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach them, shall
be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; I need not
say that the precepts here referred to are the ten commandments;
because Christ came to abolish the ceremonial law; but to fulfil
and establish the laws of the decalogue.&nbsp; Of these
&ldquo;one jot or tittle was not to be abolished&rdquo;; for
&ldquo;on them hang all the law and the prophets.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The period also in which they were to be observed and kept is the
Gospel dispensation, here emphatically called &ldquo;the kingdom
of Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; The kingdom of Victoria is the kingdom
where her laws are to be observed, and &ldquo;the kingdom of
Heaven,&rdquo; or &ldquo;kingdom of God,&rdquo; is the Gospel
kingdom in which the laws of God are to be carefully taught and
devoutly obeyed.&nbsp; Your Lordship will hardly assert that the
divine law of the Sabbath is one of &ldquo;the least of the
commandments&rdquo;; because an injunction which is intended to
preserve human life, and give the soul leisure to prepare for a
better world, can scarcely be called <i>little</i>, and certainly
not the &ldquo;<i>least</i>&rdquo;; but if it was &ldquo;<i>the
least</i>,&rdquo; yet even then the Earl of Derby, if he broke
it, or taught men to break it, or gave them a royal charter to do
so, would incur the wrath of &ldquo;The Lord of the
Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be easy to show that the Fourth Commandment, far from
being the &ldquo;<i>least</i>&rdquo; is one of the very
&ldquo;<i>greatest</i>&rdquo; of the laws of the decalogue; for
without it the other precepts would be to a great extent
unheeded; man&rsquo;s life would be shortened, and his soul
lost.&nbsp; Many have separated the ten commandments into two
classes&mdash;the first four referring to Jehovah, and the
remaining six to our fellow man.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus evidently
sums up the whole under the two ideas of &ldquo;Love to
God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love to our neighbour.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
have therefore the authority of the Divine Lawgiver himself for
this twofold division; and a very little reflection will show us
that the Fourth Command is the bond or <i>vinculum</i> which
unites the two tables of the law together.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember
the day of rest to keep it holy,&rdquo; refers to the worship of
God, and consequently to the first table.&nbsp; &ldquo;In it thou
shalt do no manner of work, thou, nor thy son, thy daughter, thy
man servant, thy maid servant, thy cattle, nor the stranger that
is within thy gates, or jurisdiction,&rdquo; embraces our
neighbour or universal man as far as our influence or legislative
power may extend; for your Lordship knows very well that the
words, &ldquo;<i>within thy gates</i>,&rdquo; include political
and magisterial dominion.&nbsp; The Fourth Commandment, then, is
a Janus&mdash;it has two faces and looks both ways: it regards
what is due to our heavenly Father, and what is due to our
brethren and sisters.&nbsp; It teaches the worship which must be
paid to the former, and the rest from labour which is needed by
the latter.&nbsp; Abolish this command, and you do away with the
public worship of Jehovah; and at the same time rob the physical
frame of your brother of that repose, and his mind of that
edification, which are absolutely necessary to his corporeal,
moral, and eternal well being.</p>
<p>Instead, then, of saying that the precept concerning the
Sabbath <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>is
a ritual, ceremonial, or positive law which is abolished, we are
fully warranted in asserting that it is one of the very
&ldquo;greatest&rdquo; of the <span class="GutSmall">MORAL</span>
commandments.&nbsp; For if the worship of Jehovah is a
<i>moral</i> duty of all ages, times, and dispensations&mdash;if
to regard the health, life, rights, and universal welfare of our
neighbour is also a <i>moral</i> obligation founded in nature,
and therefore immutable as eternal justice&mdash;then the
observance of the Sabbath, like the prohibition of idolatry,
murder, and theft, is based in the natural and everlasting laws
of rectitude, which remain unchanged from age to age.&nbsp; If we
&ldquo;love God with all our heart, mind, soul, and
strength,&rdquo; we shall hail the opportunity of ceasing from
worldly pursuits one day in seven, that we may meditate upon him,
worship him, and study his word &ldquo;without
distraction&rdquo;; and if we &ldquo;love our neighbour as we
love ourselves,&rdquo; we shall neither rob him of his day of
rest, nor hurry him to the grave by continuous labour.&nbsp; You
might, my Lord, as well strive to stay the planets in their
flight, as endeavour to be a Christian while you encourage
Sabbath labour.&nbsp; The sum and substance of all law, all
justice, all mercy, all worship, is <i>love</i>.&nbsp; The
Apostle says, &ldquo;Love is the fulfilling
(<i>&pi;&lambda;&#942;&rho;&omega;&mu;&alpha;</i>, the
fulfilment, the completion) of law,&rdquo;&mdash;of <i>law</i>,
<i>&kappa;&alpha;r&rsquo;
&#7952;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&#8134;&#957;</i>&mdash;the fulfilling
of all good, sound, healthy, equitable law.&nbsp; In connection
with the words just quoted from Rom. xiii., the inspired writer,
after mentioning the prohibition of &ldquo;adultery, murder,
theft, false witness, and avarice,&rdquo; adds, &ldquo;and if
there be any other law, it is briefly comprehended in this
saying, &lsquo;<i>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the Fourth Commandment is
especially comprehended in this love to our fellow man.</p>
<p>You, my Lord, would not like to be robbed of the comforts of
home on a Sabbath; to have your health broken up by incessant
labour; and, if a Christian, nothing would be more painful to you
than to be deprived of the rest and spiritual enjoyments of the
Lord&rsquo;s-day: then how can you wish stokers, porters, clerks,
and waiters to be thus injured?&nbsp; You must, my Lord, you must
&ldquo;love your neighbour as yourself,&rdquo; or you cannot be a
Christian; and therefore you cannot be a Christian if you
encourage Sabbath labour.&nbsp; And the railway speculators who
wanted you by royal charter to sacrifice the liberties, comforts,
health, and lives of your fellow citizens, at once deprived
themselves of all claim to Christian, humane, or equitable
principle.&nbsp; To enrich themselves, they were willing to
barter away all the dearest rights of their brethren and sisters
by robbing them of the rest of the Sabbath; and what is worse
still, they tried to cover over all this wickedness with the
pretence of having a regard to the happiness of the working
classes.&nbsp; Judas of old professed to have very great sympathy
for the poor; but we are told that his seemingly pious
considerations arose rather from avarice than benevolence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because
he was a thief and had the bag, and bare what was put
therein.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the Sydenham philanthropists feel so
much for the comforts of the poor, let them become clerks,
drivers, and waiters themselves, and carry the people <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>for nothing:
or let them devote a week-day to the gratuitous conveyance of the
masses to the Crystal Palace, and not a voice, even in obedience
to the sophistry of pseudo philanthropists, will be raised to
have the building open on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Sabbath labour, then, my Lord, is a gross violation of the
law, &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself&rdquo;; and
I am persuaded that even the misled Spitalfields weavers, and
others, when they understand the bearing of the whole subject,
have too much humanity and justice about them to wish that
workmen employed on the railway should be enslaved on the Sabbath
to minister to their pleasure.&nbsp; The operatives of our
country generally demand, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Justice for
all</span>, <span class="smcap">and favour to none</span>,&rdquo;
and therefore will hardly desire that one portion of their
brethren should be deprived of the rest and comforts of home on
the Sunday to enable another portion to indulge in various
amusements.&nbsp; This would be to imitate the slave owners,
oppressors, and tyrants whom they so loudly denounce, and would
prove that, were they in power, they would wield the iron rod of
the despot as cruelly as any Pharaoh, Nero, or Russian
Czar.&nbsp; The stoker, the clerk, and the porter have bodies and
souls.&nbsp; Six days&rsquo; toil on a railway, over the same
ground and subject to the same monotony of duties, is as
fatiguing to them as driving the shuttle or superintending the
spindle.&nbsp; There is generally no very great variety of
scenery for the clerk who gives out the tickets or the porters
who traverse the platform.&nbsp; I have known the poor railway
clerk doomed to be at his post from eight in the morning until
eleven at night during <i>all the seven days</i> of the week, and
all this for a very paltry remuneration.&nbsp; While waiting for
a train, some time ago, I had the following dialogue with a young
man who filled the office of clerk and porter, and attended to
the telegraph:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Are you the only person
employed here?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Clerk</i>.&nbsp; Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Are you here many
hours?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Clerk</i>.&nbsp; I come before seven in
the morning and leave about nine at night.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Then you have
<i>fourteen</i> hours a day?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Clerk</i>.&nbsp; I have two hours to
spare in the middle of the day, when I go home to dinner.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Have you to be here the
same time on Sundays as weekdays?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Clerk</i>.&nbsp; Just the same.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Can you ever go to a
place of worship?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Clerk</i>.&nbsp; Never, Sir.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How long have you been
on the line?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Clerk</i>.&nbsp; Upwards of five years;
and have not had an opportunity of going to a place of worship
all that time.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Did you ever attend
church or chapel?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Clerk</i>.&nbsp; I was brought up in a
Sunday School, my parents are <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>members of a Christian Church, and I
always attended myself until I was occupied on the railway.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What wages do you
obtain?</p>
<p class="gutindent"><i>Clerk</i>.&nbsp; I am paid eighteen
shillings a week.</p>
<p>Here, my Lord, are some facts worthy of your
consideration.&nbsp; You have heard a great deal about Millocracy
and the cruelties practised in the manufacturing districts.&nbsp;
I live among factories and we have &ldquo;<i>A Ten Hours
Bill</i>,&rdquo; and our operatives leave work at four, some at
two, o&rsquo;clock on Saturday, and have the whole Sabbath to
themselves.&nbsp; The wages on an average are quite equal to
those of this railway clerk.&nbsp; And yet we are told that these
masters are tyrants, oppressors, and care nothing for their
workpeople.&nbsp; But if so, what shall we say of the
&ldquo;<i>Railocracy</i>&rdquo; which is springing up among
us?&nbsp; The poor railway operative in a great number of cases
has no Saturday afternoon to himself, no Good Friday, no
Christmas-day, no Sunday, no holiday throughout the year.&nbsp;
He must never attend a place of worship, and in some instances he
is prohibited from reading during the hours that he is on the
line.&nbsp; Such a monotonous life, though spent on Parnassus, or
in the pleasant vale of Tempe, would prove fatal to all physical,
intellectual, and moral health.&nbsp; And when we consider that
some of the buildings and localities in which these poor fellows
are imprisoned are almost as comfortless as an Irish cabin, and
far worse than many gaols, we must blush for the system which
thus violates all the dictates of humanity and religion.&nbsp; We
spend some thousands a year to send missionaries to the heathen,
to teach barbarians to keep the Sabbath, but how little do those
simple hearted savages dream that, at home, we doom our own
Christian brethren to break the Sabbath and become pagans in a
land of Bibles and Gospel light, or that we have Lords who wish
for royal charters to sanction this cruelty and wickedness!</p>
<p>At the time that our peeresses and other ladies are bestirring
themselves to move the heart of woman in America to feel for her
coloured brethren and sisters in bondage, we, who boast of being
quite free from all the prejudices of colour, wish to doom our
own fellow countrymen to the slavery of the rail and Crystal
Palace, and then &ldquo;thank God that we are not as other men
are,&rdquo; nor even as those vile Americans!!&nbsp; Is it any
wonder that Brother Jonathan laughs at our philanthropy, or
tauntingly retorts, &ldquo;Physician, heal thyself!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The most complete specimen of religious grimace and morbid
sentimentalism is to see an Englishman or Englishwoman
alternately shedding tears, or burning with indignation over the
fetters of a negro on the other side of the Atlantic, and yet, at
the same moment, condemning his own free born brethren and fellow
citizens to the murderous slavery of the rail, because it will
add to the pelf of some and minister to the pleasure of
others!&nbsp; Talk, indeed, of Judas being dead; why, Mr. Mayhew,
kissing the mob in order that he may induce them first to doom
their brethren and then themselves to all the fatal consequences
of Sabbath labour and Sabbath dissipation, <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>is a
sufficient proof that the spirit of the arch traitor is still
living among us!</p>
<p>We have of late been very fond of commissions and
commissioners.&nbsp; It has been quite a money speculation.&nbsp;
We first create an evil and then employ men to inquire into the
extent of the mischief.&nbsp; We have sent into the factories,
the mines, and the agricultural districts, and children have been
expected to answer questions in religion which would have puzzled
not a few of our Lords temporal and spiritual; but let our
present Sabbath railway system continue, let the Sydenham grounds
be open, and other modes of Sabbath slavery be adopted, and we
shall soon want a Committee of the House of Commons, and a host
of commissioners to inquire into the disease, insanity, crime,
ignorance, premature deaths, and frequent accidents connected
with railways.&nbsp; It is well known that the late catastrophe
on the North-Western line near Oxford, by which six lives were
sacrificed, was mainly owing to the immoral character of the
driver.&nbsp; This man, with several other drivers and firemen,
was drinking and carousing the night before.&nbsp; His wife, the
<i>Daily News</i> tells us, had only the day preceding the fatal
collision been obliged to flee and take refuge in a
neighbour&rsquo;s house from his violence; and when he mounted
the engine, with which he hurried himself so recklessly into
destruction, and involved others in his ruin, he had just come
from a pothouse, and was under the maddening influence of
liquor.&nbsp; It has been my lot, when waiting for night trains,
to have to stay for a considerable time in station houses and
elsewhere, and there listen to the conversation of drivers,
firemen, porters, and others; and the profanity and obscenity
would hardly have been surpassed by pagans.&nbsp; And is it any
wonder, seeing Sabbath breaking, in many cases, must be an
essential trait in the character of the servants of our different
railway companies?</p>
<p>No man who reverences and worships God will break his
commandments by working on the Sabbath, and therefore in a very
little time no truly religious person will have anything to do
with railways; and hence it will come to this, that the lives and
property of millions of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects will be
entrusted to Sabbath breakers who neither &ldquo;fear God nor
regard man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Formerly we were taught that Sabbath
desecration led to every vice; but now, forsooth, all kinds of
good are to flow from the transgression of the command of the
King of Kings, and the whole community is to be placed, to a
great extent, at the mercy of those who are prohibited by their
masters from having any mercy on themselves.</p>
<p>Volumes upon volumes of facts, my Lord, might be written to
show that without a Sabbath you cannot have a <i>healthy</i> or
<i>moral</i> population.&nbsp; And surely I need not spend any
time to prove that <i>health</i> and <i>morality</i> are
essential to national prosperity and greatness.&nbsp; People
destitute of health cannot be strong and enterprising; and
citizens without good morals will bring themselves to ruin by
their own vices.&nbsp; Hence the Sabbath was divinely instituted
to preserve both.&nbsp; The rest was intended for the
invigoration of the body; and <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the leisure for religious tuition,
study, and worship was ordained for the moral edification of the
soul; and therefore if you grant royal charters for Sabbath
labour, you will shorten the days of the workpeople, and at the
same time deprive their minds of the means of religious
improvement.&nbsp; On God&rsquo;s own day you lock up or chain
the man from the sanctuary, and then on the week-day you lock the
sanctuary from the man!&nbsp; For the sake of Mammon and the
Moloch of pleasure, you slay men&rsquo;s bodies and ruin their
souls.&nbsp; Whole hecatombs of human victims are to be immolated
for the purpose of increasing the dividends of railway
speculators, and gratifying those who delight in Sabbath
desecration and in trampling the laws of God under their
feet.&nbsp; Wealth is of course valuable, and pleasure desirable,
but no one has a right to obtain either of these blessings at the
expense of his brother man.&nbsp; Money gained at the risk of the
health or life of but a single servant or operative is the price
of blood; and that cup of pleasure will end in the bitterest
sorrow which was procured by violating the divine injunction,
&ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are therefore, my Lord, on the plain principles of
humanity, called upon to use your influence that the grounds of
the Crystal Palace shall not be opened on the Sabbath.&nbsp;
Though you rejected revelation; though you supposed the moral law
abolished; though you believed that human senators are prohibited
from legislating on any subject on which Jehovah has given a law;
yet it would then be your duty to exert yourself to prevent
Sunday trading and labour.&nbsp; All persons admit that life and
property are proper objects for political laws.&nbsp; Hence you
have various sanitary regulations.&nbsp; There are laws
respecting public nuisances, drainage, and common sewers: you
have statutes prohibiting the keeping of pigs and other animals
in cities and towns: you have enactments concerning public
houses, gin palaces, putrescent fish and vegetables: you have
penalties to protect persons from dangerous footpaths, machinery,
and poisonous gases; murder and theft are punishable by law; and
neither parents, masters, nor mistresses are allowed to maltreat
their children, servants, or dependents.&nbsp; If I mistake not,
I was in the House of Commons, when I heard your Lordship
advocate the Factory Act; and you have the Ten Hours Bill and
laws respecting the labour of women and children in mines and
factories: the sale of intoxicating liquors in the Crystal Palace
was forbidden; and ale houses are closed until noon on the
Lord&rsquo;s-day; and we have reason to believe that your
Lordship approves of all these enactments.&nbsp; And we presume
that you do so because all of them, either directly or
indirectly, involve the preservation of the health, lives or
property of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; And now, my Lord,
upon the very same grounds and reasons we call upon you to
interfere in the case of the Sydenham Palace.&nbsp; We know, and
you, my Lord, know full well, that higher motives might be urged;
but we now pass these by, and simply plead, that the opening of
the said pleasure gardens on the Lord&rsquo;s-day, in consequence
of the Sabbath labour that would be attended therewith, would be
an infraction of the <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>natural rights of many of your
neighbours and fellow citizens, and therefore ought to be
prohibited by law.</p>
<p>It is now demonstrated beyond all controversy that man&rsquo;s
body wants rest at the end of every six days.&nbsp; History and
physiology, independent of religion, assure us of this
fact.&nbsp; If you deny to the horse, the ox, the ass, or the man
the rest of the Sabbath, you kill him before his time; and
consequently on the same principle of humanity on which you
passed &ldquo;<i>The Ten Hours Bill</i>,&rdquo; and uphold laws
against murder, we call on you to defend the clerks, porters,
drivers, and other servants of the Sydenham speculators from the
evils of Sabbath occupation.&nbsp; It is said by some that we are
a godless age; and by others that we are a most enlightened and
religious generation; and somehow or other both these classes
coalesce to crush the poor labourer and shorten his life by
robbing him of his Sunday.&nbsp; The godless people beg us not to
be so fanatical as to make any law on any subject on which
Jehovah has legislated; and the enlightened and hyper-religious
entreat us not to sanction any statute respecting the right of
the labourer to rest from toil on the seventh day, because it is
a religious question!!&nbsp; You may make a &ldquo;<i>Ten Hours
Bill</i>&rdquo; because it is not mentioned in the Bible; you may
even enact a law against murder and theft, although both are
mentioned in the Word of God; but alas! alas! to make a law to
save the poor tired, worn out, weary, oppressed operative or
clerk from being injured by Sabbath labour, would be to
un-Protestant yourself and prove that you do not understand
religious liberty!!&nbsp; As if religious liberty consisted in
the liberty to kill our brethren and sisters by continuous
labour!!&nbsp; If there had been no Fourth Commandment, given by
God himself, we should have heard nothing about this
matter.&nbsp; There was no Fourth Command about the &ldquo;<i>Ten
Hours Bill</i>&rdquo; and therefore it passed; but now our poor
operatives and peasants are to be robbed of their rights and
burdened with over work, because their heavenly Father has said,
&ldquo;Remember the rest-day to keep it holy.&nbsp; Six days
shalt thou labour and do all thy work; but the seventh is the
Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt do no manner of
work,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Therefore, as Jehovah has said we
shall do &ldquo;no manner of work,&rdquo; you, my Lord, propose
that a royal charter shall be given to railway directors to
enable them to exact labour from their servants on the
&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who can after this doubt
our piety, our enlightenment, our staunch Protestantism, or our
love to religious liberty?</p>
<p>These are some of the blessings which we are told belong to
Christian freedom, and the Gospel dispensation!&nbsp; If our
overworked mechanics, operatives, and labourers lived under the
darkness and bondage of the Mosaic law, then, poor souls! they
might have a good week&rsquo;s wages for <i>six</i> days&rsquo;
work, and have one day in seven to rest, recruit their strength,
enjoy their homes, bless their families, and improve their minds
and morals; but seeing they live in an age of Gospel light, they
are to be blessed with <i>seven</i> days&rsquo; hard work, no
rest from toil, no leisure day to taste the sweetness of home and
train themselves and their families for this world and that to
come!&nbsp; It <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>will require no common sophistry to persuade the simple
minds of the masses that it is an overwhelming privilege, to work
<i>seven</i> days instead of <i>six</i>, and often without any
increase of wages!&nbsp; Many of them will wish they were Jews,
and that the law of Moses was still in force, that they might
rest one day in seven, and enjoy the sweets of home and the
blessings of religious worship and instruction.</p>
<p>Then how absurd to suppose that we must not legislate
concerning the Sabbath, because Jehovah has legislated on
it!&nbsp; And yet we legislate on murder, theft, &amp;c.,
although both these crimes are forbidden in the decalogue.&nbsp;
Is this because there are no Sydenham speculators in the way of
observing these commands?&nbsp; But if we legislate concerning
the right of the labourer to rest on the Sabbath, we shall
prevent certain gentlemen from robbing the poor to enrich
themselves, and from shortening the lives of one body of citizens
to increase the profits of another.&nbsp; Of course it would be
vastly inconvenient to give every one license to rob, steal, and
take away life; but forsooth, the case is much changed when,
instead of licensing all to plunder and destroy, you make a
monopoly of the business, and grant to Crystal Palace adventurers
the privilege of defrauding their servants of one day in seven,
of corrupting the morals of their fellow citizens, and shortening
their days by oppressive toil.&nbsp; There is a tribunal before
which Lords and Commons, employers and employed must appear, and
before which a director has lately been suddenly summoned.&nbsp;
There, my Lord, the highwayman who robbed with the pistol, and
the noble or squire who more genteelly, with an Act of
Parliament, or royal charter, plundered the labourer of one day
in seven, will be placed in the same company and indicted for the
same offence; and where also those who destroyed their brethren
more speedily by prussic acid; and those who did it more slowly,
but not less cruelly, by hard and continuous labour, will be
ranked with Cain and his fraternity.&nbsp; Nor will it be any
mitigation of their crime to plead that they would have granted
&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">Seventh Day Bill</span>&rdquo; as
well as &ldquo;A <span class="smcap">Ten Hours
Bill</span>,&rdquo; if it had not been that the Bible forbad
Sabbath labour.&nbsp; But as the Universal Father out of pure
love to his children commanded that labour should not be exacted
on the seventh day, therefore it behoved human legislators to
countenance Sunday occupations, lest by following the dictates of
heaven, of justice and humanity, they should violate the
principles of religious liberty!!!</p>
<p>How many persons will be employed every Sabbath on the
Sydenham Railway and in the gardens we cannot tell, nor need we
trouble to inquire, because it is too much to sacrifice the
liberties, rights, health and life of but ONE INDIVIDUAL.&nbsp;
Were the French, the Russians, or the Turks wantonly to kill but
<i>one</i> Englishman, we should demand satisfaction.&nbsp; And
shall we allow ourselves to plunder and destroy our poor brethren
because we hope to enrich a few speculators thereby?&nbsp;
Granted that the pleasure of a thousand, or of a hundred thousand
may be obtained by such cruelty, yet the amusement and recreation
of millions is but as the small dust of the balance when weighed
against the rights and the life of but <span
class="GutSmall">ONE</span> labourer or <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>operative.&nbsp; But, my Lord, the mischief will not be
confined to <i>one</i>, or <i>two</i>.&nbsp; We are told that the
working of the Sunday train from Edinburgh to Glasgow compels at
least one hundred persons to break the Sabbath.&nbsp; Probably
quite as many will be required for the Sydenham business; and
therefore the sacrifice of human comfort, rights, health and life
will be very great.</p>
<p>And it must be remembered that but few of the men and women
employed will have time to enter a place of worship on the former
part of the Lord&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; Granted that the visitors to
the grounds may very devoutly go to church and pay their
devotions to the Eternal before they hasten to break his
Sabbath!! yet firemen, porters, waiters, &amp;c., will hardly
have time to repair to the sanctuary before they put the engines,
&amp;c., in readiness for their masters&rsquo; customers; so that
the majority of these railway servants will be deprived of the
opportunity of worshipping God and learning their duty.&nbsp;
Here then, my Lord, will be robbery and cruelty of the worst
kind, and therefore we call on you as a man to interfere between
the oppressor and the oppressed.&nbsp; If you never went to
church, and prayed that God would have mercy upon you and
&ldquo;incline your heart to keep the Fourth Commandment&rdquo;;
if you disbelieved revelation altogether; if you were a Jew,
Turk, infidel, or the most ultra dissenter, yet then we would
appeal to your humanity and entreat you to interpose the shield
of the law and protect the servants of the Sydenham directors,
and indeed all labourers, from being robbed and destroyed by
Sabbath occupations.</p>
<p>The question then, my Lord, is a <i>physical</i> one, and just
as much within the range of parliamentary prohibition as any
other which involves the property and lives of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp; There is not a law in the statute
book more just or humane than the enactments against Sabbath
labour.&nbsp; The poor man has as equitable a claim to rest for
twenty-four hours, every seventh day, as he has to sleep, to
food, or protection from the thief and the assassin.&nbsp; Sunday
is his own property, and no other day can now be substituted in
its place.&nbsp; His physical frame demands it, and must be
injured if deprived of its refreshing repose; and his family and
home must be rendered desolate if robbed of the presence and
smile of its husband, father, instructor and companion.&nbsp; We
pity the orphan and the widow, but Sunday labour deprives the
mother and her children of their best friend for months and years
in succession.&nbsp; It is true he may come home every night, but
then it is generally when his little ones are in bed, and he
leaves in the morning before they are up; and should he visit his
house during the day, in many cases they are at work, or at
school.&nbsp; You cannot, my Lord, give another day that will be
a compensation for the loss of the Sunday.&nbsp; Should our
railway directors resolve to grant their servants a day every
week as a substitute for the Sabbath, still the exchange would
not be an equivalent.&nbsp; On the Sunday the whole family rests
from labour; all the members are at home; the house is nicely
cleaned; wife and children are dressed in their best, and all
their resources of domestic happiness <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>are at hand.&nbsp; These blessings
cannot be had on the Monday, Tuesday, or any other day of the
week.&nbsp; On the Sabbath the labourer is as free from toil and
care as the nobleman, the prince, or the monarch; and this weekly
leisure and independence are enjoyed by all his family.&nbsp; The
whole community also has an opportunity of participating in these
comforts, so that the people sympathize with each other in their
rest from work, and the endearments of home which are thus
elicited and cherished.&nbsp; Very great also are the
intellectual, moral, and religious privileges of the
Sabbath.&nbsp; But these physical, social and spiritual
advantages and pleasures cannot be shared on any other day.&nbsp;
All sorts of occupations will call the various members of the
family from home; instead of the neat and quiet Sabbath
appearance of the house, wife, children, neighbours and friends,
all will be bustle and confusion, and everything will wear the
aspect of business, labour and toil.&nbsp; No one will sympathize
with the week-day rest of the railway operative.&nbsp; His wife
is in her every day garb, and perhaps obliged to leave home to
follow her calling.&nbsp; Did he rest on the ordinary Sabbath, he
would enjoy it along with others; but by the unjust arrangement
which makes his Sunday a week-day, and his week-day a Sunday, he
has to work when others are free from toil; and when he has a
period of repose, others are at work; and the noise and labour
with which he is surrounded prevent him from having that rest and
social enjoyment which he might share with his friends and
relatives on the general Sabbath.&nbsp; And then most of the
sanctuaries are closed, and thus he is as much shut up from the
means of salvation as if he were transported to some heathen
land.</p>
<p>You are therefore, my Lord, about to inflict incalculable
evils and injuries upon a large portion of the most valuable of
your fellow citizens.&nbsp; The working classes are very
important members of the commonwealth.&nbsp; We cannot all be
kings and queens; and trade, commerce, agriculture, manufactures,
railways and domestic life, would be in a very pitiable condition
if all were lords, squires, great capitalists, and Crystal Palace
speculators.&nbsp; Our clerks, operatives, peasants, hard handed
fustain jackets, smock frocks, &amp;c., make the wealth and the
comforts of the nation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Princes and peers may flourish or may
fade&mdash;<br />
A breath can make them, as a breath has made;<br />
But a bold peasantry, their country&rsquo;s pride,<br />
If once destroyed, can never be supplied.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to our Sabbaths, Sabbath Schools, Bibles, and Gospel
Ministry, we have in this favoured land of ours, the most
industrious, upright, contented, and moral population under
heaven.&nbsp; It may suit speculators in State Education to
malign the working classes, and to exaggerate the ignorance and
vice that may exist among us, but still after making every just
allowance for our intellectual and moral defects, we are prepared
to prove, that there is no country on the globe which can boast
of a race of operatives and peasants equal to the English.&nbsp;
And are these the men and women who are to be robbed of their
Sabbaths and the comforts of home?&nbsp; Is this the return which
lords and gentlemen <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>are about to make for their large revenues and peaceful
mansions?&nbsp; It is no use, my Lord, to say that you only
propose to injure, corrupt, and destroy a few, for the benefit of
the many, because the country may have all necessary amusement
without Sabbath desecration and without inflicting an evil on
anyone; but if it could not, you have no right to rob even <span
class="GutSmall">ONE</span> man of his day of rest, his health
and his home, to increase the wealth or minister to the
recreation of others; and therefore, instead of sanctioning this
injustice, it is the solemn duty of the Government to enact such
laws as shall secure to the labourer full exemption from toil on
every seventh day.&nbsp; Works of absolute necessity and deeds of
charity and mercy may be attended to.&nbsp; All <i>requisite</i>
domestic duties may be performed: the sick and the young may be
nursed: the ox and the ass may be led away to watering: or if
either fall into a pit, it may be helped out; but then these
occupations and occurrences will interfere very little with the
rest of the Sabbath, and therefore can bear no comparison with
continuous employment on that sacred day during the whole
year.</p>
<p>Should your Lordship, or any of my readers, be doubtful
respecting the physical evils arising from Sabbath labour, I may
again refer to the Blue Book, containing the Parliamentary
Evidence respecting Sabbath occupations.&nbsp; The testimony of
the medical men and especially of Dr. Farr on this point is
particularly worthy of notice.&nbsp; I may also quote the
following words of another well known London Physician of long
experience and great practice.&nbsp; The venerable Dr. Conquest
of Finsbury Square, in a letter to the churchwardens of St.
Luke&rsquo;s, says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I regret my inability to be at the vestry
this evening.&nbsp; Had it been in my power to be there, I should
have endeavoured to prove, as <i>a medical man</i>, that it is
<i>absolutely necessary</i> for the <i>human constitution</i> to
have <i>one day in seven for rest</i>, because <i>without it</i>,
its <i>powers</i> become <i>enfeebled</i> and
<i>impaired</i>.&mdash;<i>Daily exertion</i> and
<i>excitement</i> and <i>fatigue</i> during the week, without
this one day&rsquo;s rest, <i>prematurely break down</i> the
<i>strength</i> and <i>vigour</i> of the <i>animal system</i>,
<i>shorten life</i>, and <i>deprive old age</i> of that
<i>energy</i> and <i>cheerfulness</i> which usually attend it in
<i>those who have rested from mental and bodily toil on the
Lord&rsquo;s-day</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is not a physiologist or medical man in the country who
understands the physical and metaphysical nature of man, but
would subscribe to these sentiments.&nbsp; Here then you are
shown that health, corporeal, mental and moral energy, and
longevity, depend upon the rest of the Sabbath, and consequently
that disease and premature death will arise from Sunday labour,
and yet we are told that we must not legislate on this subject
because it is a religious question.&nbsp; We grant that it is a
religious question, but then it is a physical and social question
also.&nbsp; Are not legislative enactments on murder, theft, on
the cholera, factory labour and poisons, physical and religious
questions at the same time?&nbsp; Yea, are they not religious
because they are physical?&nbsp; Is it not a social, a physical,
and a religious duty to preserve life and protect the rights of
the labourer from the injustice of the oppressor?&nbsp; No one
has a greater dread of over legislation, or legislation where
conscience is concerned, than the writer of this Letter, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>but then who
would say that legislating against murder and robbery must be
shunned out of deference to the consciences of murderers and
thieves; or because the duty to avoid these crimes is a religious
duty; and therefore in making any laws respecting them we should
violate the great principles of Religious Liberty, as though it
was a part of Religious Liberty to grant to all sorts of
assassins, plunderers, and speculators, the liberty to defraud
and slay their brethren and dependents?&nbsp; Dr. Conquest, Dr.
Farr, and many other skilful and experienced physiologists have
proved, and are prepared to prove, that Sabbath labour shortens
life, and this fact alone renders legislation on the subject the
solemn duty of every humane government, whether that government
consists of pagans, Jews, Turks, infidels, or Christians.</p>
<p>The remarks given above from Dr. Conquest have been borne out
by all history and observation.&nbsp; Some years ago, Mr.
Wilberforce endeavoured to persuade certain lawyers and
barristers that Sunday occupations and consultations would
shorten their days.&nbsp; They laughed at his fanaticism, sneered
at him as a &ldquo;<i>Saint</i>,&rdquo; and were quite ready to
&ldquo;<i>Charivari</i>&rdquo; him; but all these mockers died
before their time.&nbsp; Some of them became melancholy
imbeciles, and more than one committed suicide.&nbsp; We cannot,
my Lord, violate the laws of God, whether written on the
digestive organs, muscles and brain, or in the Bible, without
having to pay the dire penalty of rebellion against the
benevolent regulations of our heavenly Father.</p>
<p>We have heard a great deal of late concerning the Anglo-Saxon
race, and its native vigour, enterprise, intelligence,
&amp;c.&nbsp; All our greatness has been attributed to physical
causes, and these causes have been supposed to originate in the
purity of our race.&nbsp; But the argument is absurd, because we
are the most mixed and mongrel people under heaven.&nbsp; We have
all sorts of blood in our veins.&nbsp; We are a compound of
Ancient Britons, Romans, Scots, Irish, Saxons, Danes, Normans,
French, Germans, Phenicians, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; And yet we
boast of being Anglo-Saxons!!&nbsp; There is more scepticism than
science in this vaunting.&nbsp; Men are unwilling to do homage to
Christianity, and &ldquo;to render to God the things that are
God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; We owe all to the Bible and the
Sabbath.&nbsp; The former, by circulating sound principles among
us, has given us vigorous minds, and the latter by the repose of
one day in seven, has imparted to us healthy physical
constitutions.&nbsp; The rest from toil and worldly anxiety; the
soothing associations of leisure, home, moral principle, and
religious hope, have wrought wonders on our muscles, nerves,
brain, and digestive organs, and thus have given us vigorous
bodies; intrepid, enterprising, and persevering minds; moral
courage; and honourable, humane, and philanthropic
sentiments.&nbsp; What made the sturdy men of the Reformation and
of the Commonwealth, but the Bible and the Sabbath?&nbsp; And if
Anglo-Saxon must be a synonym for physical vigour and moral
courage, then history, science, philosophy, and religion allow us
to say, that the Bible and the Sabbath would make Anglo-Saxons of
the Celts, the French, the Germans, the Chinese, and of all the
world.&nbsp; Our venerable <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>ancestors, both Episcopalians and
Puritans, who built up the British constitution and rendered it
the wonder, the glory, and terror of the world, saw that man must
have a day of rest, and therefore made it a statute of the realm
that labour should cease on the Lord&rsquo;s-day; and we owe our
national preeminence to their wisdom and piety.&nbsp; You ought
therefore, my Lord, to hesitate before you remove those
&ldquo;ancient landmarks which your fathers set up&rdquo;; for
you may rest assured that as soon as you break up the good old
Sabbath observance habits of our forefathers, and introduce, in
its stead, Sunday labour and dissipation, you will hear no more
of the vigour of the Anglo-Saxon race; for with a continental
Sabbath you will have continental frivolity, effeminacy,
fickleness, and revolutions; and it may be well for your Lordship
to consider whether under such a change the nobility of England
will share better than the clergy, the gentry, the nobles and
princes of France under the reign of terror.&nbsp; The Bible and
the Sabbath, if duly studied and observed, would have saved that
country from all the melancholy and frightful calamities which it
has had to suffer during the last sixty or seventy years.</p>
<p>Everyone, my Lord, who advocates Sunday labour, is not only an
enemy to the working man, but an adversary to the country at
large.&nbsp; It is impossible for such a man to be a patriot,
because he endeavours to undermine the physical and moral vigour
of the empire.&nbsp; It is no use to say, that in opening the
Crystal Palace on the Sabbath, you advocate the amusement and not
the labour of the masses; because you are going to doom one body
of your countrymen to toil that they may enrich and please
others.&nbsp; And depend upon it, when it is generally understood
that railway directors can have <i>seven days&rsquo; labour</i>
for fifteen or twenty shillings a week, other masters will exact
the same hard terms from their workpeople.&nbsp; They will
naturally ask, Who are we that we should pay as much for <i>six
days</i>, as the railway lords do for <i>seven</i>?&nbsp; The
certain result to the working classes will be increased labour
and diminished wages; and thus under this pretence of giving
Sunday recreation to operatives and others, one of the most
deadly injuries will be inflicted upon them.&nbsp; They have
often been duped by designing demagogues, but now it seems
Conservative Lords and Radical Dissenters are to be their
deceivers.&nbsp; Of old Herod and Pontius Pilate were made
friends when the Son of God was to be crucified; and in our time,
we have lords and plebeians, Conservatives, Whigs, Radicals,
Chartists, Atheists, debauchees, Episcopalians and
ultra-Dissenters&mdash;all leagued together to rob the poor
brethren of Jesus Christ, of their day of rest, and the ten
thousand blessings connected therewith.&nbsp; We congratulate
you, my Lord, on your companions, coadjutors, and fellow
labourers: though we know that you must not hope much from the
certain result of your zeal.&nbsp; It is often said that our
Norman nobility have never naturalized themselves in this foreign
land, and the present effort to destroy the physical and moral
greatness of the nation by Sunday labour will go far to prove
that they have not as yet become English patriots.&nbsp; Sabbath
amusement for one class will be Sabbath slavery to another; and
as this <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Sabbath labour and desecration increases, the nation
will fall and will most certainly involve the nobility in its
ruin.</p>
<p>Much is said of recreation and comfort for the working
classes, but we must be just before we are generous, and not
forget the rights and happiness of those who are to be
worked.&nbsp; I have before said that England owes much to its
domestic circles and its homes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Home! sweet
Home!&rdquo; is an air which charms everyone among us; but do
away with the Sabbath, and you destroy the English home.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said a child, &ldquo;you seem so happy
always on a Sunday, I wish it were Sunday every day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are always better on a Sunday when father&rsquo;s at
home,&rdquo; said a little girl to her sick mother.&nbsp; Another
said, &ldquo;Oh, we are so uncomfortable to-day, it don&rsquo;t
seem like Sunday, because father has been at work all day, and
has not cleaned himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t the sun
always shine brighter on the Sunday? and it is never such nasty
wet rain on a Sunday as on other days,&rdquo; exclaimed another
group of children.&nbsp; But the sick wife of the railway
servant, and the fond children, are to know nothing of these
Sabbath endearments.&nbsp; Sunday suns and Sunday rains will be
week day suns and rains to them, and this will continue from
year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Really, my Lord, as a
religious individual, and consequently a very feeling,
sympathetic, and humane man, you ought to hesitate before you
resolve to destroy domestic ties and affections to which your
country owes so much of its happiness, prosperity, and
greatness.&nbsp; Your good Lady, the Duchess of Sutherland, and
others, are calling loudly upon the Americans to pity the poor
negro, and we beg your Lordship to have some compassion for these
intended Crystal Palace slaves, and not allow their homes to be
broken up and their wives to be as widows and their children
orphans.</p>
<p>The idea, my Lord, that large numbers of the masses will run
down to the Crystal Palace <i>every</i> Sunday is an idle
fancy.&nbsp; What will it cost for a man to take his wife and
children to Sydenham?&nbsp; In many instances from six to ten
shillings will be needed!&nbsp; Will Mr. Mayhew&rsquo;s
Spitalfields weavers be able to spare this sum?&nbsp; How many
times a year will they go?&nbsp; How many of them will go?&nbsp;
For unless they go very often, we are afraid that their moral
improvement will not be very great; and, during the Sabbaths that
the people stay at home, there will be no very great diminution
of the crowds that occupy the filthy lanes and alleys of
London.&nbsp; Will enough on any one Sunday leave their houses to
cause any visible decrease of the inhabitants?&nbsp; Will whole
families go? or will there not be a separation of its
members&mdash;some gone to the Crystal Palace, and coming home
drunk or ruined, while the poor wife and other portions of the
household will be left in solitude at home?&nbsp; One would
suppose, to hear some people talk, that as soon as Sydenham is
opened, all the miserable wretches in London, all the ragged half
starved creatures, and especially all the poor operatives in
Spitalfields, will, by some magic or miracle, be well clothed,
have plenty of cash in their pockets, and after going to church
very devoutly one half of the Sabbath, hurry away in full glee to
the Crystal Palace on the other, and thus <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>their future
Sundays all through the year will be passed between the celestial
paradise of the temple and the earthly Elysium at
Sydenham!!&nbsp; No one after this will laugh, if a new body of
speculators should arise and propose to take these said paupers
and operatives to visit the moon and all the planets every
Lord&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; And thus, my Lord, for an imagined good,
which it would be the most arrant folly to anticipate, you are
about to sacrifice the home comforts, the health, the morals, and
the lives of a large number of the most valuable of your
countrymen.&nbsp; The same principle that led you to legislate
respecting cruelty to animals, and to the men, women, and
children in factories and mines, calls upon you to interpose the
authority of the law, and say to the Sydenham gentlemen,
&ldquo;There shall be no labour on the Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are told that if the men hire themselves out to this
drudgery it will be a <i>voluntary</i> act of their own.&nbsp;
Granted, my Lord; but still when a husband and father, who has a
wife and family crying for bread, is told that he may have
employment if he will break the Sabbath, but that famine shall be
the result of his resting on the Lord&rsquo;s-day, there is great
danger that many will prefer transgression to poverty and
want.&nbsp; All persecutors are perfect voluntaries.&nbsp; It was
quite optional for Stephen to be stoned; for the disciples to be
imprisoned; for Huss, Latimer, and Hooper to be burnt; for the
pilgrim fathers to emigrate to America; and for the Madiai to go
to gaol.&nbsp; Persecutors are among the fairest people under
heaven.&nbsp; They generally set comfort and torture, life and
death, before their victims, and give them a perfect choice of
either.&nbsp; Formerly burning was fashionable; but now
starvation is nearly all the rage.&nbsp; We do not burn people in
this enlightened day.&nbsp; We are too refined, for we live in
the nineteenth century, to be sure.&nbsp; No persecution now,
forsooth, we are too humane for that.&nbsp; We only say to the
famishing operative or peasant, &ldquo;You must go to church, or
starve!&rdquo; &ldquo;you must go to chapel, or starve!&rdquo;
&ldquo;you must spend your Sabbaths on Sydenham Railway, or
starve!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now I really think, my Lord, if you had your
choice, notwithstanding all our boasting of religious liberty and
charity, that you would as soon be burnt by Bonner as starved to
death, wife, family and all, by these more refined modern
persecutors.&nbsp; For say what you will, Sunday labour is not
only inhuman and cruel, but it is persecution, and ought to be as
much restrained by the hand of the law as any other oppression
which would prevent men from worshipping God.&nbsp; I knew one of
the best of men in London leave his fatherland and become an
emigrant because of the Sunday labour at the Post Office, and
thus the government lost a good servant by this
persecution.&nbsp; And we shall soon have on a large scale a new
race of pilgrim fathers, who will seek refuge in a foreign land
that they may enjoy the Sabbath which they are refused in their
own Christian country.&nbsp; To turn a man off from work because
he fears God and keeps the Sabbath is persecution.&nbsp; The
civil government is as much bound to protect the day for worship
as the temple in which the man worships.</p>
<p>Again we repeat, we desire no interference with the religious
opinions of anyone.&nbsp; Let men spend their Sabbath as they
please, <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>provided they do not compel others to any unnecessary
work.&nbsp; The laws respecting murder, theft, cruelty to
animals, prisons, nuisances, factory labour, do not interfere
with the religion of Catholic, Protestant, Episcopalian, or
Dissenter.&nbsp; They merely protect the health, the bodies and
rights of the people, and on these principles we call on the
legislature in the name of humanity, of justice, of health, life,
right, and freedom, to prohibit Sabbath labour.</p>
<p>Drowning men catch at straws, and you are in danger, my Lord,
of being seduced by certain individuals who call themselves
liberal dissenters, and profess to expound the sentiments of
their brethren.&nbsp; They will tell you that you must not
legislate to prevent the poor man from being robbed and killed by
Sunday labour, because it is a religious question!!&nbsp; But you
must beware of these gentlemen.&nbsp; They have not the
confidence of their brethren, nor do they represent their
views.&nbsp; Their sentiments are as outrageous as they are
ultra.&nbsp; To say that Dissent allows the working man to be
robbed and slain by oppressive masters; to be starved to death,
or persecuted into exile, is one of the foulest libels that has
ever been uttered.&nbsp; These men have not yet learnt the duties
of civil legislation.&nbsp; They have not distinguished between
physical and religious&mdash;between bodily and spiritual
matters; they have not learnt that in some points human and
divine legislation must go hand in hand; nor have they
ascertained where the one is to stop or where the two are to
diverge.&nbsp; A man who holds with a &ldquo;Ten Hours
Bill,&rdquo; with laws to prevent cruelty to women, children, and
animals; with statutes to prevent murder, theft, and swindling,
and yet protests that you must not protect the bodies of men from
Sabbath labour, is a novice in humanity, and has yet to learn his
political alphabet.&nbsp; Sabbath labour is inhuman; Sabbath
labour is robbery; Sabbath labour is cruelty; Sabbath labour is
persecution; Sabbath labour is deadly; and therefore ought to be
restrained by the authority of the law.</p>
<p>Some of them become very religious and tell you that every
day, under the Christian dispensation, is to be a Sabbath; but
they do not mean what they say.&nbsp; Sabbath, my Lord, signifies
<span class="GutSmall">REST</span> from labour; and if every day
is to be a Sabbath, then we must rest from labour everyday, and
never do any work at all!&nbsp; Jehovah has said, &ldquo;six days
shalt thou labour and do all that thou hast to do, but the
seventh is the DAY OF REST.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rest from labour is one
of the <i>essential</i> ideas included in the word Sabbath; and
these pious people say that every day is to be a <i>Sabbath</i>,
and therefore a day of <i>rest</i> from toil; for where there is
no cessation from labour, there is no <i>Sabbath</i> in the
scriptural meaning of the term.&nbsp; But so perverted are these
reasoners, that they tell us though Sabbath means rest from
labour, yet people are now at perfect liberty to work all the
day, and Sydenham adventurers ought therefore to be allowed to
rob, demoralize, and kill a portion of the population by Sunday
toil!!&nbsp; The reasoning of these gentlemen is as logical as
their legislation is liberal and humane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;The Sabbath is
abolished!&rdquo;&nbsp; But where, my Lord, is the repeal
mentioned?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they gravely reply, &ldquo;The
Sabbath <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>was made for man.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, it was
benevolently instituted for the rest of his physical frame and
the edification of his soul.&nbsp; <i>Ergo</i>, it is
abolished!!&nbsp; Glorious reasoning, my Lord!&nbsp; But still
they argue, &ldquo;The Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Ergo</i>, the Sabbath is abrogated, and
he is the Lord of a nonentity!!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No <i>man</i> is to judge us in respect of new moons
and Sabbaths.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ergo</span>, the
<i>Lord</i> is not to judge us, although he has given us the ten
commandments, and told us that they are not abolished, and that
the law is not in any point made void by faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day is changed from the seventh to the first.&nbsp;
<i>Ergo</i>, it is abolished!!&rdquo; <i>Change</i> and
<i>abolition</i> synonyms!!&nbsp; The Apostles for a while
observed the seventh day that they might preach to the Jews, and
the <i>first</i> day that they might assemble as Christians, and
at length, in obedience to their Lord&rsquo;s will, these
<i>inspired</i> men dropped the seventh and kept the first alone,
but retained the spirit of the law by assembling <i>every
seventh</i> day, and therefore, to be sure, broke up the Sabbath
altogether!!&nbsp; Whether these are
&ldquo;<i>sequiturs</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>non
sequiturs</i>,&rdquo; I leave your Lordship to judge.</p>
<p>But then we are so spiritual in these Gospel days, that we do
not need a Sabbath.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ergo</span>, we
show our spirituality by <i>secularizing</i> the Sabbath!!&nbsp;
Of course we are more spiritual than the Creator who consecrated
one day in seven; more spiritual than Adam in innocency; than
Moses, Samuel, Isaiah, the Prophets, our Lord, or the Apostles;
and therefore we can do without such vulgar things as Sabbaths or
religious instruction.&nbsp; Doubtless the Gospel has given us
iron nerves and muscles to labour incessantly; and now forsooth
we are all born with instinctive morality, theology, and
devotion, and can do without such old fashioned, obsolete lumber
as religious edification!&nbsp; And yet, my Lord, we who thus
boast are the most Mammon worshipping, worldly minded people
under heaven.&nbsp; We are so spiritually minded that we wish the
labourer to work <i>seven</i> days instead of <i>six</i>; that we
open the Crystal Palace on Sundays for the sole purpose of
getting money out of the pockets of the people!&nbsp; We are so
spiritual that almost everything we do is contaminated with
selfishness!&nbsp; We are so evangelical and heavenly that we are
robbing and killing our fellow creatures by Sunday labour, and
are agitating to increase these hecatombs of human victims
offered to avarice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Song of the Shirt&rdquo; is
no exaggeration, and therefore what a spiritual and benevolent
people we must be!&nbsp; What wicked fellows those infidels are
who doubt the divine origin of this cruel caricature of
Christianity which we give them in our deeds, and how depraved
they must be to say to such spiritually minded souls, &ldquo;What
do ye more than others?&rdquo;&nbsp; What a blessed proof of
heavenly mindedness, that we can rob men of their Sabbath and
lives, and then thank God that we are not as other men are!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the early Christians did not legislate concerning
the Sabbath,&rdquo; say your new friends.&nbsp; But then you
know, my Lord, that they did not ask the government to make any
laws against murder or theft; they did not agitate against
slavery; for the franchise; for <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>corn-laws, or their repeal; for the
Union, or &ldquo;The Separation of the Church and State,&rdquo;
&amp;c. &amp;c.; and if we imitate them, we shall give up civil
legislation altogether.&nbsp; What Paul would have done, if he
had been a Member of Parliament, we can hardly say; still, we may
safely affirm that he would as soon have voted to keep men from
being robbed, persecuted, and killed by Sabbath labour, as he
would for a bill to prevent cruelty to men, women, children, or
animals, and would hardly have dreamt that in so doing he was
violating the great principles of religious liberty.</p>
<p>Another favourite argument which some use and urge, they tell
us, &ldquo;with tears in their eyes,&rdquo; is that you will draw
people from the gin palaces.&nbsp; That is, my Lord, you are
&ldquo;to do evil that good may come.&rdquo;&nbsp; You have
committed ONE great crime by licensing men to poison, corrupt,
and destroy the population by strong drink; and now you are to
give a royal charter for a second crime, that you may counteract
the first!&nbsp; This is adding sin to sin.&nbsp; Why not shut up
all public houses on the Sabbath?&nbsp; It is as much our duty to
do so as to legislate concerning the sale of stinking fish, or to
prevent any nuisance which endangers the health and rights of the
people.&nbsp; And then do you think, my Lord, that these gin
palace visitors will go every Sunday to Sydenham?&nbsp; Some of
them now idle away one, two, or three days a week in pothouses,
and spend money enough to pay for sight seeing and a railway
excursion every week.&nbsp; Will Sabbath breaking and the Crystal
Palace convert them into pious men and women?&nbsp; &ldquo;Credat
Jud&aelig;us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are at present in London several parks, which any of
these persons may visit for nothing, and without enslaving any of
their fellow citizens to minister to their amusement; and
therefore it is perfectly superfluous to open the Sydenham
Railway on the Sabbath.&nbsp; London, for its wide thoroughfares,
fine buildings, and extensive walks, is one of the most healthy
and splendid cities in the world; and is continually being made
more and more so.&nbsp; Why then wish to license by royal charter
a system of amusement which must be attended with Sabbath
desecration and the slavery of the workmen employed in conducting
it?&nbsp; Besides, if there are not walks enough, let others be
made, that the masses may have all the resources of health at
command without injury to the domestic comforts, rights, and
liberties of any of their fellow citizens.&nbsp; We do not want
to shut every man, woman, and child up on a Sabbath.&nbsp; All
that we desire is, that Sunday labour shall be restrained by law;
and we demand this on the same broad principle of justice that we
ask for any regulation connected with the civil rights of the
country.</p>
<p>It is a fact that numbers of those who now keep public houses,
&amp;c., would be glad to have a general law passed to close them
on the Sabbath.&nbsp; At a public dinner of licensed victuallers
and publicans in Manchester last October, one of the speakers,
who had several houses and carried on a large trade, entreated
his brethren to shut up on the Sabbath; and assured them that he
always did so himself, and had been a great gainer in consequence
of the improved character of his <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>servants, which arose from their
being allowed to rest on the Sabbath, and attend to their moral
improvement.&nbsp; Our gin palaces might all be closed on the
Lord&rsquo;s-day, and then there would be no drunken population
on the Sunday, and no need of a Sydenham claptrap to pretend to
cure one crime by the committal of another.</p>
<p>Most of our pseudo philanthropists who are agitating for
Sabbath recreations, are after all no real friends to the
masses.&nbsp; They seem to take it for granted that operatives
and labourers should never have any time for amusement but on a
Sunday; and that nature intended them to be &ldquo;hewers of wood
and drawers of water&rdquo; for twelve or fourteen hours during
every week-day.&nbsp; But we protest against this cruel
creed.&nbsp; Let taxes be lowered, national expenditure
economised, sinecures abolished, peace and free trade with all
countries be cultivated; let especially the taxes on knowledge be
repealed, and the lords and squires show that they are patriots
by giving up their pensions and refusing to receive such enormous
salaries; let the wages of the labourer and mechanic be just and
equitable, and let the nobility, clergy, gentry, and religious
people do their duty by teaching and encouraging provident and
moral habits; and then the working men and women of England will
be able to enjoy week-day recreation much more frequently than
they would go to the Crystal Palace on a Sunday: and thus they
will be saved the moral deterioration which must invariably
attend on Sabbath desecration, and will have no need to enslave
any of their brethren to minister to their happiness.</p>
<p>It is said we are losing hold of the masses.&nbsp; But, my
Lord, this is a great delusion.&nbsp; The fact is we have never
as yet laid hold of them as a body; and we have not done so,
because we have never used the proper means.&nbsp; And yet, bad
as things are, I never walked through any of the worst haunts of
London without being assured by persons of age and experience,
that things are not half so bad as they were twenty or thirty
years ago.&nbsp; And the improvement is going on.&nbsp; There are
more churches, chapels, and schools than were in existence in
former years, and more persons attending them; there never was in
the whole history of the country so many of the masses found in
the house of God, or under a course of religious instruction; and
the only thing that can prevent this reformation from going on,
is Sabbath labour and the opening such places as the Crystal
Palace on the Lord&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; I have, Sabbath after
Sabbath, preached in Sion Chapel, Whitechapel, to between three
and four thousand persons, most of them operatives from
Spitalfields and the neighbourhood, and yet within a
stone&rsquo;s throw the Rev. Mr. Champneys had Whitechapel Church
thronged; and just at hand other churches and chapels were well
filled.&nbsp; It is untrue to talk of our losing hold of the
masses; they never attended on the house of God in such numbers
as now, nor were they ever in so favourable a condition to be won
by Christian exertion.&nbsp; Infidelity, trades unions,
socialism, halls of sciences, dissipation, thieving, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., have all failed, and they are now literally waiting to
be gathered to the fold of Christ.&nbsp; But if they were not,
the man who would suppose, that opening a Crystal Palace on
Sundays <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>would supply these poor souls with funds to go there,
and would catch them all and make them first-water citizens and
Christians, must be a wilder enthusiast than has ever yet entered
the walls of Bedlam or St. Luke&rsquo;s.&nbsp; My Lord, there
never was a greater hoax than this Sydenham speculation; and the
arguments used in its favour, show us what sanctimonious fanatics
some men will stoop to be if gain can be won by pretended
philanthropy and godliness.</p>
<p>But it is added, that we are to use <i>moral</i> means to win
the masses; and we reply that we propose to employ no
other.&nbsp; We view the Sabbath in its two aspects as a civil
and a religious institution&mdash;as a physical and a spiritual
boon to mankind; and we do not wish that the legislature should
enact one law respecting the religious observance of the day; we
only ask the Government to fulfil its political duty by securing
to the labourer that exemption from toil which would injure his
health, and of which wicked men would rob him if the civil power
did not interfere.&nbsp; We are not so foolish as to suppose that
mere rest from labour is religion or holiness to the Lord; but we
do believe that the rest is necessary for instruction in
holiness; and therefore we say to the State, You do your duty and
protect the labourer from toil, and then let the Church use all
proper moral means to influence him to spend his Sabbath in such
a manner as shall conduce to his intellectual, moral, and eternal
welfare.&nbsp; But our ultra liberals, after becoming quite angry
and calling us a number of ugly names, exclaim, &ldquo;We depend
on the omnipotence of moral means&rdquo;; and then turn around to
a host of sharpers and say, &ldquo;You may depend upon our utmost
aid in enabling you to keep these poor fellows from ever having
the least chance of coming within the reach of these moral
means!&nbsp; Work the slaves as much as you like, work them seven
days a week, we will see that no legislative enactment shall
secure them from being slain by labour, or give them leisure to
come to the house of God&rdquo;!&nbsp; How infidels, atheists,
the speculators in the nerves and muscles of their fellow man,
and all who view the operative as a mere beast of burden, exult
as they thus behold religious liberty voluntarily stooping to
minister at the altar of Mammon, and victimize the working
classes; boasting of moral force, and labouring hard to put the
people beyond the reach of its power!</p>
<p>It is said, &ldquo;The rich break the Sabbath, and that many
professing Christians pay little attention to its sacred
dictates&rdquo;; <i>ergo</i>, the poor man must be robbed of his
day of rest!&nbsp; This, my Lord, is the logic of your friends,
as though doubling or trebling a crime could consecrate it.&nbsp;
Every Sabbath breaker, whether monarch, lord, priest, or
pretended saint, is really and truly a Sabbath breaker, and
therefore is no Christian; and as a thousand thefts or murders
cannot sanctify one, so thousands or millions of acts of Sabbath
desecration cannot alter God&rsquo;s law or man&rsquo;s physical
constitution.&nbsp; There stands the law engraved on man&rsquo;s
muscles, nerves, and brain; and written also by the same Divine
Physiologist and Lawgiver in the sacred volume: &ldquo;Remember
the day of rest&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;in it thou shalt do no manner
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>of
work,&rdquo; &amp;c., are the words; and woe be to him who dares
break this &ldquo;commandment, or teach men to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was surprised to read in several newspapers the reasons
which you, my Lord, assigned for granting a charter for this
Sabbath cruelty.&nbsp; You stated that you wished to open the
Palace for &ldquo;the <span class="GutSmall">HEALTH</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">COMFORT</span>, and <span
class="GutSmall">MORALS</span> of the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
confess that I hardly believed my own eyes, and I perused several
reports of your speech before I gave them credit.&nbsp; But let
us examine them a little.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Sabbath desecration for &ldquo;<i>the health of the
people</i>&rdquo;: that is, you propose to shorten the lives of
one class of men, for the supposed health of others!&nbsp; This
is not very humane.&nbsp; And then, Sabbath desecration injures
rather than promotes health.&nbsp; This was shown long since in
the Parliamentary evidence on the observance of the
Sabbath.&nbsp; Masters who employ large bodies of men, know full
well how to distinguish the workman who spends his Sabbath in a
moral and religious manner, from those who pass it in tea
gardens, travelling, and dissipation.&nbsp; The latter are said
to be frequently &ldquo;not worth their salt&rdquo; on a Monday;
while the former are healthy, strong, and vigorous for labour,
showing that the Sabbath has had its intended refreshing,
re-creating, and quickening influence on their bodies, minds, and
morals.&nbsp; There is plenty of Sabbath amusement in Paris and
on the Continent; but then many of these poor creatures are half
dead on the morrow, and require a Saint Monday to restore
them.&nbsp; The bills of mortality also of London, for many years
past, without a Crystal Palace, will bear comparison with any of
the great cities abroad.&nbsp; And if, my Lord, you will obtain
correct statistics of the health and longevity in the metropolis
or the country of those who break and of those who rigidly
observe the Sabbath, you will never say another word about
Sabbath desecration as necessary to health.&nbsp; I am quite
willing to stake the whole question on the health of the Sabbath
School teachers of London.&nbsp; With all due deference, you must
allow us to believe that the Great Physiologist who made
man&rsquo;s body and breathed into it an immortal soul, was not
inattentive to our health and life, when he gave the Fourth
Commandment; and certainly viewed the human family with as much
tenderness as the Earl of Derby.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Sabbath desecration for &ldquo;<i>the comfort of the
people</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, my Lord, you intended to omit
the comfort of the men and their wives and families who are to be
employed in the Sydenham speculation.&nbsp; These poor creatures
will have little comfort on the Sabbath.&nbsp; The father will be
at work and the family will be at home bereft of its best
friend.&nbsp; And then as to the others, who are to be amused and
comforted, I am prepared to show that the families of those who
keep the Sabbath are ten thousand times more comfortable than of
those who break it.&nbsp; Let the homes of the working men in
England who observe the Lord&rsquo;s-day, be examined in
connection with <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>the homes of labourers and artisans on the continent,
and we do not fear what will be the result of such an
investigation even in this single matter of comfort.&nbsp; Yes,
and let Spitalfields be scrutinized, and a fair report be given
of the condition of those who keep, and of those who break the
Sabbath, and, my Lord, the comparison will most triumphantly
prove that there can be a far higher degree of comfort enjoyed
from religion than any Crystal Palace can yield.&nbsp; There are
hundreds of happy families in Spitalfields and elsewhere, who are
happy because they are pious and keep the Lord&rsquo;s-day
holy.&nbsp; To them the Sabbath is a foretaste and earnest of
heaven.&nbsp; When the morning of the day of rest dawns, they
hail it with the words of Newton,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How welcome to the saint, when pressed<br
/>
With six days&rsquo; care and pain and toil,<br />
Is the reviving day of rest,<br />
Which hides him from the world awhile!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or else they sing, with Watts,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Welcome, sweet day of rest,<br />
That saw the Lord arise,<br />
Welcome to this reviving breast<br />
And these rejoicing eyes&rdquo;!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among these poor people you will find some of the happiest
persons upon the face of the globe, and in their homes ten times
more comfort than is enjoyed by their Sabbath breaking neighbours
who have better wages.&nbsp; Keeping the Sabbath aright
invariably leads to domestic comfort and happiness; while
breaking it, as certainly produces misery; and therefore, my
Lord, it was bad domestic, bad political economy; bad physiology,
bad morality and divinity to talk of increasing the comforts of
the people by Sabbath dissipation.&nbsp; All history, all
statistics, all observation, all nations, all Scripture are
against your proposition.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Sabbath desecration for &ldquo;<i>The Morality of
the People</i>!!&rdquo;&nbsp; This, my Lord, is certainly the
climax of all.&nbsp; We used to be sent to the &ldquo;Newgate
Calendar,&rdquo; and were told that Sabbath breaking led to all
sorts of vice, but now the tables are turned, and working on the
Sabbath and the neglect of divine worship and religious
instruction are to bring the Millennium!&nbsp; You have been, my
Lord, in France and especially in Paris on the Sabbath.&nbsp;
There they have all sorts of pleasure gardens, costly trees and
shrubs, museums, picture galleries, crystal fountains, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., open to all the public without a fee on the
Sabbath.&nbsp; The Palais Royal; the Palace of Vend&ocirc;me; the
Palace of the Tuileries, and its gardens; and the Champs
Elys&eacute;es, with its splendid walks, will perhaps bear
comparison with anything we shall have at Sydenham; and I
certainly never expect to see any exhibition in this country that
will vie with the palaces, waterworks, and illuminations at
Versailles and St. Cloud.&nbsp; These, my Lord, have been for
years thrown open to the people.&nbsp; France from time
immemorial has been renowned for its popular amusements and
Sunday sights and recreations, and yet these did not save the
nation from &ldquo;<i>Sans Culottism</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>&ldquo;The
Reign of Terror,&rdquo; and all sorts of mad revolutions.&nbsp;
With all these grand sights and the morality of Sabbath breaking,
the French and the Continentals cannot be trusted with scarcely a
particle of liberty, but must be kept in order with the bayonet;
while your own immoral countrymen, who are in danger of becoming
savages without a Crystal Palace, know so well how to take care
of themselves that you trusted the Crystal Palace in their hands
without a single soldier to protect it.&nbsp; With these facts
before us, it sounds rather strange to hear your Lordship talk of
improving the morality of the people by Sabbath desecration, when
it is as clear as any fact of the present time that we owe our
morality, our national contentment, security, progress, and
preeminence, to our observance of the Lord&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; Do
away with the Sabbath, my Lord, and Sans Culottism may yet reign
in England, even though the Sydenham Palace may very far surpass
Versailles and St. Cloud.</p>
<p>But if Crystal Palaces have such virtue that a visit once or
twice a year to its gardens will make the vilest of the people
moral, I am thinking, my Lord, that some will begin to imagine
that we may soon dispense with archbishops, bishops, deans, and
all the other expensive apparatus of a State Establishment.&nbsp;
We may be sure that not one in ten of those who go to Sydenham
will think of going to church before they start on the
railway.&nbsp; Indeed, many argue that the Palace is to be opened
to moralize and spiritualize those who will not at the present
time enter our churches or chapels.&nbsp; And this said Sydenham
is to perform such marvels in virtue and piety as Joanna
Southcott and Mormonites never ventured even in their wildest
flights to anticipate.&nbsp; And if so, why not plant gardens,
construct fountains, and erect Crystal Palaces generally?&nbsp;
Many of the clergy and dissenting ministers we are told have
miserable congregations at present: why not make them porters and
waiters at Sydenham, seeing railway men, it is supposed, will
produce more morality in a few hours than some of your clergy and
dissenting ministers can call forth in many years?&nbsp; And if
the plan will work so well in the afternoon, why not have it in
the morning? and then there will be no need of mocking the
Almighty by praying for grace to keep the Fourth Commandment at
the moment that we intend to trample it under our feet.&nbsp;
Depend upon it, my Lord, there are not a few who will conclude
that under such a moral and religious dispensation as that which
the Crystal Palace adventurers have proposed to bring in, the
property of the Church may go to pay off the national debt.</p>
<p>I may have seemed to treat this matter with levity, but was it
possible to discuss such arguments with seriousness? to talk of
gardens, &amp;c., producing morality, when history shows us what
architecture, pleasure grounds, and such like inventions did for
Egypt, Nineveh, Babylon, Rome, and other countries, who with all
these incentives to piety became the victims of their own
vices?&nbsp; But I will not enlarge except to say that you
cannot, my Lord, follow a better guide than the Bible, nor confer
a greater boon on the nation than to preserve its Sabbaths from
being violated by labour.&nbsp; I have now <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>been nearly
thirty years at Ebley, and during that time have preached to a
large congregation, most of them poor people, and have had ample
opportunity of seeing the effects of Sabbath breaking and Sabbath
observance.&nbsp; I am told that our chapel and schools, as seen
from the Great Western Railway, look like a little paradise, and
I could show your Lordship as many happy homes as perhaps any
minister in any agricultural and manufacturing district in the
country.&nbsp; I wish your Lordship would send a commissioner to
look at us, for we could then prove by visible facts, that
&ldquo;health,&rdquo; &ldquo;comfort,&rdquo;
&ldquo;morality,&rdquo; intelligence and pure religion flow, and
flow alone, from strict obedience to the Fourth
Commandment.&nbsp; I had intended to say more to prove that the
keeping of the seventh day is as obligatory now as in the days of
Moses, but I will reserve those arguments for a separate essay,
and in the meantime remain, my Lord,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your Lordship&rsquo;s obedient
Servant,</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>March</i> 10<i>th</i>, 1853.</p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I ought, my Lord, to have added above that some
persons, from this expected rage of the poor people to go to the
Crystal Palace on Sundays, and its moralizing influence, will
draw an argument in favour of the Voluntary Principle in religion
which your Lordship has so long condemned.&nbsp; For if these
children of destitution will pay such large sums to be educated
and moralized at Sydenham, what need of State Education, tithes,
or religious endowments?&nbsp; I should not be surprised to hear
it proposed to have St. Paul&rsquo;s and Westminster Abbey turned
into Crystal Palaces.&nbsp; In making these remarks I am only
reasoning on the premises laid down by your Lordship, that the
people would be rendered &ldquo;<i>moral</i>&rdquo; by going to
the Crystal Palace on Sundays.&nbsp; Bishops, priests, deacons,
and dissenting ministers, it is presumed, have failed; and now
dram shops are to be emptied, and Spitalfields, St. Giles, and
Rosemary Lane regenerated by the Sydenham grounds!&nbsp;
Certainly, my Lord, before this new experiment is tried, it would
be well to inquire, whether the Bible, Christianity, and
Religious Instruction are a failure? whether Sabbath breaking
will be more moralizing than Sabbath observance? whether the poor
people in London will have money enough to go in shoals to
Sydenham? and whether those who will really go will not be the
persons who have ample time and means to go on the week?</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
